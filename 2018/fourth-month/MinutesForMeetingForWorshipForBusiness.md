We began with silent worship and the reading of the following query: "In
our worship and prayers, do we ask the Spirit to help us 'rejoice and be
glad in the call to serve those easily forgotten: the unborn, the
migrant, the elderly, the destitute, the victims of trafficking and so
many others? May we allow God's grace to enlarge our hearts in order
that we might find happiness and holiness.

Minutes of the Third Month Meeting for Worship with a Concern for
Business were approved with the correction of Eighteenth Day of Second
Month to Eighteenth Day of Third Month.

painting is nearly complete. The Committee is collecting estimates for
the front Juniper removal to allow for easier access and the future
installation of a handicap ramp. The ad-hoc committee for discerning
whether an addition to the Meeting House should be pursued has not yet
been formed. [Ellen][EllenCooney], [Linda][LindaSeeger], [Molly][MollyWingate], 
[Kelsey][KelseyKennedy] and [Ann D.][AnnDaugherty] have expressed an
interest in being part of this committee. For the remainder of April,
[Ellen][EllenCooney] will have custody of our phone 719-232-1853. [Ann M.][AnnGrantMartin] has
volunteered to monitor the phone for the Month of May.

reminders: "I Am Not Your Negro" will be viewed at the Meeting House,
April 25, 2018 at 6:00 PM. Soup and Worship Sharing will be held May 11,
2018. Phil and Lisa will be our hosts. The query offered "How might we
as Quakers interact with representatives of white supremacy and hate
groups?" was approved by all attending.

**The State if the Meeting Report**, beautifully written was approved
with the modification membership remains stable at 15 not 16.

### The Peace and Social Concerns Committee
Minutes were approved with
the corrections of CD to DVD and that the next Meeting will be the last
Wednesday in May at the Meeting House. We are able to rent a projector

Negro. [Ellen][EllenCooney] has acquired the DVD. [Kelsey][KelseyKennedy], 
[Claire][ClaireSheridan], [Austin][AustinHawk] and [Ann][AnnDaugherty] will
make calls to see if we might borrow a projector. This will be open to
the Public. [Claire][ClaireSheridan] mentioned that DeAnne Butterfield will be in Colorado
Springs May 24 and that this might be a time to plan a Lobbying Workshop
rather than after IMYM gathering in June. There was discussion whether
or not we time to plan this workshop by May 24. [Kelsey][KelseyKennedy] and 
[Claire][ClaireSheridan] will
confer with DeAnne to see what her wishes might be.

We have a least one Friend on the three sub committees of the Sanctuary
Coalition. The coalition is soon expecting a request to host a sanctuary
guest.

### Finance Committee
[Kelsey][KelseyKennedy] presented the Profit and Loss statement
for the first quarter of 2018 and the Balance Sheet as of March 3, 2018.
[Kelsey][KelseyKennedy] noted that the transition has been a little "bumpy". 
[Kelsey][KelseyKennedy]
stated that we will continue to use Quickbooks. We have changed from
the desktop to the cloud version. We will continue to spend about $200
per year for this use. The P & L Statement and Balance Sheet were
accepted as presented.

The various Committees' minutes and reports are hereby included by
separate documents.

We closed in silent worship.
