    regarding how our traditional testimonies guide us on stewarding
    financial resources and economies.

2.  Minutes from the April business meeting were approved.

3.  Peace and Social Action Committee: is willing to serve as clerk.
    Yea, yea, yea. [Ann][AnnDaugherty] and [Linda][LindaSegar] attended the sanctuary meetings, they
    will vote at the Unitarian congregation about spending money to
    install a shower and offer sanctuary. A Minute prepared by Mountain
    View Meeting for FGC regarding supporting an internal audit on
    institutional racism was shortened and revised by [Molly][MollyWingate]. 
    Our Meeting
    applauds FCG's action and pledges to examine ourselves in this way.
    The Meeting approved a Minute from Peace and Social Action committee
    to be forwarded to Jamie Newton at Peace and Social Concerns. Quaker
    Quest is on the back burner, FGC has now laid down the model. Letter
    writing packets and materials are available on top of the bookcase.
    The next group writing session may be in August. Committee report
    was accepted.

4.  Meeting House Committee Report: The drainage pipes off the bathroom
    roof will be replaced with downspouts. We are adding mulch and
    working to xeriscaping the front of the property. The cost for the
    sewer was $23,499, we have paid $11,000. There is a crack in the
    front door frame. We're looking at ways to beautify the chair rack.
    Last one out please take the trash and add TP to the bathroom if
    needed. Committee report was accepted.

5.  Ministry & Oversight: did not meet because of [Ann][AnnGrantMartin]'s surgery. The
    committee will review a copy of Boulder Meeting's policy and
    procedure book on keeping children safe and bring it to this
    business meeting in the future. In preparing for the upcoming
    wedding, the committee recognized a need to prepare for some of the
    finer details in advance and will review this matter as well.
    Committee report was accepted.

6.  Finance Committee: There is $300 available for travel scholarships
    to IMYM. We received donations to help with the sewer repair. The
    $6,500 check from the grant funds arrived. The Meeting authorized
    the treasurer or finance clerk to issue notes to three individuals
    for private loans of $2,000 each with interest at the T-bill rate
    payable in 90 days. We filed a claim for damages with the city of
    and are hopeful the city will pay us for their share of
    responsibility in this sewer problem. Committee report was accepted.

7.  Announcements: Pamela Haynes' book *Toward a Right Relation with Money* 
    is available on line at IMYM.org.
