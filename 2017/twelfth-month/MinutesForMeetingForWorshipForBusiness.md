    and Stewardship.

2.  Minutes from the eleventh month business meeting were approved.

3.  Meeting House Committee Report: The painting contract will be placed
    for $1,850. The sense of the meeting was to keep some blue color
    rather than all gray. The back door was left open before today's
    meeting we are reminded to be sure all is locked up after use.
    Please ask for Meeting approval before donating items to the
    Meetinghouse. The committee received a request to consider making
    Wifi available in our building. Committee report was accepted.

4.  Ministry & Oversight: Friendly calls are complete. Next meeting is
    on the third Tuesday in January. Committee report was accepted.

5.  Peace and Social Action Committee: Job descriptions are now in draft
    form. Six attended Elmer's refugee presentation. The committee
    requests $20.00 for postage costs. The committee recommends
    additional worship sharing groups on the topic of racism in our
    Meeting. Committee report was accepted.

6.  Finance Committee: we received sufficient pledges to estimate
    $1,020 per month income which will allow for rebuilding of our
    reserves and possibly add to the building fund. We are hiring a new
    bookkeeper. Final approval of the budget will be at the January
    business meeting. The committee asks for input and ideas on how to
    allocate any extra funds we receive. This month we dispersed local
    funds as follows: $50.00 to PPJ&P and $50.00 to All Souls
    sanctuary project. Committee report was accepted.

7.  Nominating Committee: Nominees for new positions will be approved in
    January. We still need another member for finance committee. [Jeremy Nelson][JeremyNelson]
