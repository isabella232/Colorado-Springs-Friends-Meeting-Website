1.  The Meeting opened with silence and a reading from "What is our Business Meeting?". 
2.  Minutes from the fifth month business meeting were approved with two corrections. 
3.  Meeting House Committee Report: We are working on the South window, fire extinguishers 
    need recharging, recently the back door was left open and a window was left unlocked. 
    The front door was left unlocked twice when the door was not pulled closed.  Please slam 
    it and double check it before leaving. We are each asked to pull ten weeds if able and 
    keep the front mulched area clear. If we use the screens in the windows rather than 
    leaving the door open during Meeting, we will keep the bugs out. Committee report was accepted.
4.  Ministry & Oversight: [Ellen][EllenCooney] is faithfully attending the committee 
    meeting as a guest. [Jon][JonathanMcFee] and Chris’s wedding was lovely and guests 
    were very respectful of Quaker traditions. Friendly calls were initiated by committee 
    members.  The committee is discussing development of child protection policies and 
    best practices for first day school. The Meeting discussed the need to reactivate a 
    First Day School Committee vs. a Religious Education Committee and avoid having 
    Ministry and Oversight shoulder too much responsibility. 

    [John Gallagher][JohnGallagher] and the Boulder Meeting actively explored these child 
    protection issues for IMYM this year. [Claire Sheridan][ClaireSheridan] will contact 
    [John][JohnGallagher] and the Boulder Meeting and report back. Committee report was accepted.
5.  Peace and Social Action Committee: No report. The sanctuary group will meet Tuesday 
    and a radio show will air soon. The Meeting discussed legality of sanctuary movement. 
6.  Finance Committee: No report; did not meet secondary to health issues. Will soon 
    circulate finalized accounting of how the sewer got paid. Committee report was accepted. 
7.  Announcements:  
    [Ellen][EllenCooney] sent several emails to the woman from a ministry of Friends in 
    Moscow who wants to talk to anyone interested, but has yet to receive a response. 

    Friends are reminded about making individual contributions to the Unitarians 
    toward their remodel in anticipation of offering sanctuary. There are requests for 
    hospitality on the list serve from Quakers moving to the area. [Sarah’s][SarahCallback] 
    solar party is this Wednesday, July 19th, at 6:00 p.m. we will begin Adult Education 
    for Quaker 101 on the second Sunday in September at the rise of Meeting. Any 
    interested person is welcome. 

    [Sarah][SarahCallback] will be stepping aside from all things financial (bookkeeper 
    and finance committee chair) as of the end of the year. She asks the nominating 
    committee to consider a replacement. The Meeting wishes to recognize and honor 
    [Sarah][SarahCallback] for all her hard work year in and year out for the last 14 years.  

The Meeting closed in silence. 


Respectfully submitted,


[Julia Roten- Valdez][JuliaRotenValdez]
