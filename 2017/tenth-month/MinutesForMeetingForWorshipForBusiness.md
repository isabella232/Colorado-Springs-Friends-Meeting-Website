# MEETING FOR WORSHIP FOR BUSINESS
## 15th Day of Tenth Month, 2017

## Minutes

Present were: [Ellen Cooney][EllenCooney], [Ann Grant-Martin][AnnGrantMartin], 
[Julie Roten-Valdez][JuliaRotenValdez], [Claire Sheridan][ClaireSheridan], 
[Molly Wingate][MollyWingate], [Kelsey Kennedy][KelseyKennedy], [Austin Hawk][AustinHawk].

1.  The Meeting opened with a quote on opening to spirit followed by silence.

2.  Minutes from the September business meeting were approved.

3.  Meeting House Committee Report: Information and directions regarding the sump pump
    are in the red cabinet. The smell in the meeting house continues, additional possibilities
    for a solution were suggested including moving the sofa out temporarily or covering it in
    plastic and opening the windows several hours per day. The heat seems to be turning
    off and on randomly- referred back to the Meeting House Committee. Contents of crawl
    space reviewed, gutters will be cleaned, evergreens will be trimmed and paint applied to
    window sills. Bring your ideas and suggestions for changing our food preparation area
    to [Lisa][LisaLister]. We are reminded to check with Meeting House Committee before 
    bring donated items to the Meeting House and to make certain the building is secure when 
    you are the last one out. Committee report was accepted.

4.  Ministry &amp; Oversight: [Ann][AnnGrantMartin] reviewed the importance of Friendly calls, 
    shorter messages, political messages and staying open to spirit. The Meeting approved a 
    workshop on centering prayer. Committee report was accepted.

5.  Peace and Social Action Committee: Minutes circulated October 15<sup>th</sup> . 
    [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty] wrote a summary on the status of the sanctuary coalitions 
    and present occupants. The Meeting made a contribution and individuals are invited to 
    contribute as well. Watch for information of the grass roots, non-violent meetings coming 
    up in Arizona November 10-12. The committee proposes a worship sharing on Saturday 
    November 18th at 3:00 p.m. around the racism queries. The December potluck 
    will be used for the IMYM queries. Committee report was accepted.

6.  Finance Committee: The committee is working with Nominating Committee to fill the
    bookkeeper position being vacated by [Sarah][SarahCallback]. Our 501c3 status and 
    corporation documentation issues are being reviewed for the future. The committee 
    is working on soliciting pledges and creating the budget for 2018. Since IMYM will 
    go to a pay as lead model, there will be no further scholarship requests from individual 
    Meetings. We can consider transferring that previously budgeted amount directly to 
    yearly meeting. Please note our file cabinet downstairs is our centralized place for 
    important meeting documents including corporation documents, minutes and building mechanicals.
    Committee report was accepted.

7.  First Day School Committee: [Claire][ClaireSheridan] and [John][JohnGallagher] would welcome 
    more members as we consider the safety of children.

8.  Nominating Committee will be convening soon. Please let [Lisa][LisaLister] or [Jeremy][JeremyNelson] 
    know where your interests or willingness lie.

9.  Announcements: Centering Prayer workshop which shares commonalities with
    Quakers, Buddhists, Catholics, Presbyterians and others will be offered in January
    hosted at our Meeting House but open to the wider community in Colorado Springs as
    well. Experiment in the Light might be helpful reading. [Molly][MollyWingate] spoke 
    recently with a child in the neighborhood who thought our building was vacant and 
    abandoned. [Ellen][EllenCooney] will
    pursue a community picnic at the neighborhood school, Helen Hunt elementary. A
    poetry group may be interested in using our meeting space. We will consider ways to
    use the Hillside community center and the possibility of using the Helen Hunt
    playground during First Day School.

10. The Meeting closed in silence.

Respectfully submitted,

[Julia Roten-Valdez][JuliaRotenValdez]
