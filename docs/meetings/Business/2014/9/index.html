   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   <h1>Minutes for Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business</h1>
<h2>Colorado Springs Friends Meeting</h2>
<h3>Twenty first day of the ninth month</h3>
<p>In Attendance: <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a>, <a href="/Friends/BillWerling">Bill Werling</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a>, <a href="/Friends/AnnGrantMartin">Ann Grant Martin</a>,

<p>Meeting opened with silence at 11:28 followed by the following reading from 
    Britain Yearly Meeting:   <em>We do not own the world, and its riches are 
    not ours to dispose of at will.  Show a loving consideration for all 
    creatures, and seek to maintain the beauty and variety of the world.  Work 
    to ensure that our increasing power over nature is used responsibly, with 
    reverence for life.  Rejoice in the splendor of God's continuing creation.</em></p>

<p>Acceptance of minutes:</p>
<p><strong>Sixth month:</strong> <a href="http://coloradospringsquakers.org/meetings/Business/2014/6">http://coloradospringsquakers.org/meetings/Business/2014/6</a>
approved with corrections</p>
<p><strong>Seventh month:</strong> approved with corrections (paper copy), pending being posted </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Committee Reports</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ministry and Oversight Committee</strong> - the minutes accepted for both 
    August and September committee meetings.  In the September committee 
    meeting there was discussion about the suitability of asking at the 
    rise of meeting for "messages that did not rise to the level of Meeting 
    for Worship." It was the sense of those present at that Ministry and 
    Oversight Committee Meeting that it would be best to have Messages 
    spoken only during Meeting for Worship.  We thank M&amp;O for their careful 
    and worshipful consideration of this issue.  Details can be found in the 
    M&amp;O Minutes for ninth month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meeting House Committee</strong> - the minutes accepted for September.  This 
    month during the work day the committee suggests that we: haul the trash 
    out from behind the meetinghouse, mow one more time, perform the usual 
    housekeeping, and maybe repaint the basement floor.</p>
<p>The problem of the scratched floor under the back table was discussed.<br />
The committee will look into getting a rug for under the table, perhaps 
one to match the larger rug. </p>
<p>The committee posed two questions to the Finance Committee: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Can we afford $400 to remove the stump?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we afford to bring in an electrician to install additional 
    electrical outlets?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finance Committee</strong> - the minutes and financial reports were accepted 
    with many thanks.  <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a> indicated that 
    deposits have remained down over the past two to three months.  The 
    Finance Committee will send out pledge letters in October. It was 
    further reported that utility costs have been down. With the $100 we 
    have available for distribution to national organizations, it was 
    determined that $50 would be given to support the efforts of Mike Gray 
    and the other $50 would be donated to the Ramallah Friends School to support 
    their efforts.  </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> also indicated there was not currently enough money 
in the Meeting Home Special Projects fund to support stump removal and 
that the Meeting Home Committee should pursue a quote for the electrical 
costs before a determination could be made to see if it can be funded.</p>
<p>Balances Reported (end of August)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Checking: <strong>$192.50</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Savings: <strong>$7615.77</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building Fund: <strong>$9254.44</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Library</strong> - The library committee report was given orally by the 
    Librarian, Nancy Andrew.  She is  using LibraryThing.com as the 
    software to organize our library collection. You can now search 
    for books in our collection online (at least the portion of our 
    library collection that has been cataloged). There was discussion 
    about the need to determine what the focus or emphasis will be for the library.<br />
    It was determined that this will be discussed at the business meeting in 
    November. There was also additional discussion about where to house the 
    collection in the meeting house and the possibility of eventually building 
    permanent bookshelves. </p>

<p><strong>Announcements</strong></p>
<p><a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a> &amp; <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a> are teaching a four-part 
course, "Hope for the Holy Land," to be held Oct. 2, 9, 16 and 23 at High 
Plains Church, evenings from 6:30-8:30.  ($20 donation suggested).  </p>
<p>Soup and Sharing at 6 PM Sunday, Nov. 9 at the home of <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> 
and <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil Friesen</a>. The plan is to share with each other our 
thoughts on: Why am I a Quaker/ Why do I come to Meeting, and What has Quakerism 
contributed to our Community, and other fundamental queries. If those who attend 
conclude, after this session, that it would be well to offer a two-evening 
Introduction to Quaker origins, values, processes and practices, delving deeper 
into who we are, who we were and where we are going, we will do it at a later date. 
At this point we need expressions of interest.</p>
<p>At the rise of the meeting on October 5th we will hold a Potluck to say "Goodbye" 
to <a href="/Friends/DanielKidney">Daniel Kidney</a>.  Please join us as we wish him well in his journey.</p>
