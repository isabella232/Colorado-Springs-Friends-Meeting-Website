   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>Started at 11:28 am with Opening silence</p>
<p>Reading from British Yearly Meeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be aware of the spirit of God at work in the originary activities and experience of your daily
life. Spiritual learning continues throughout life, and often in unexpected ways. There is 
inspiration to be found all around us, in the natural world, in the science and arts, in our 
work and friendships, in our sorrows as as well as in our joys. Are you open to new light, 
from whatever source it may come? Do you approach new ideas with discernment?

<p>Committee Reports</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Finance Committee new meeting time and place, meeting time second 1st day
    at 11:30 after Meeting for Worship. Following a suggestion by Meeting House committee, 
    a generous bequest from a recently deceased friend that we fully fund the 
    Meeting reserves as :</p>
<p>*.  $540 towards reserves for three months of utilities payments</p>
<p>*.  $10 towards emergency fund to place it at a fully funded $575 plus monthly dividends</p>
<p>*.  $1,430 towards reserves for three months of mortgage payments</p>
<p>The finance committee request the following queries to be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does the Meeting approve of the Meeting House Committee's  suggestion to use some of
    the bequest for building reserve needs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the Meeting approve of the Finance Committee's proposal as to how
    to distribute the bequest?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann</a> brought up that various Friends travel expenses have increased, 
that the remaining $3,020 be for some other purpose. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> expressed her desire to 
keep the funds together to honor the Friend's bequest. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton</a> to create a new seed funds for the new addition with this money into a 
new savings account at ENT. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> talked about the importance of 
being a good steward of Friends donations.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, the meeting approved the finance committee's proposal 
to fully fund the topping up the reserves and creating a new savings account
with the remaining funds as seed money. </p>
<p>Cash flow went down because of our distributions and other expenses not budgeted,
utilities expense significantly lower than last year. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> went over
financial reports from the Meeting. In the Revenue statement, the positive sum in the general fund should be 
celebrated as it shows that Meeting is operating but the building fund is negative. 
We do building projects when the money is available from monies received as donations and
the negative balance in this building account reflects budgeted projects and does not 
reflect unbudgeted expenses. In the balance sheet report, total liabilities and net assets 
of the meeting in 2013 was $106,294.47. The Meeting expressed gratitude for the work done on 
these reports and accepted the Finance report. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ministry and Oversight Committee (Minutes attached), February 4th at 11am. 
    <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> suggested that the Meeting minutes to not include names of Friends in the 
    minutes in order to preserve privacy. <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton</a> was also surprised with the inclusion of 
    personal names in the report that will posted publicly. Friends mentioned the 
    concerns of putting names in the official minutes. The minutes for M&amp;O would not be 
    made publicly. </p>
<p>M&amp;O is requested to clarify the membership of a Friend and if he is officially a member of the 
meeting. </p>
<p>Next M&amp;O meeting will be on February 4th 2014 at 11am.</p>
<p>The concerns of Friends privacy in M&amp;O report and what should be included in the Meeting public 
presence on website will be brought to M&amp;O by <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a Yearly Meeting what do we value in providing programming for youth? What does 
your meeting want to see in youth programming at IMYM?  In particular, what 
suggestions does your meeting have for keeping a vital and loving Junior Young 
Friends program at IMYM?  What are your leadings about support for Middle School youth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa</a> has already sent her personal thoughts to <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a> on these queries. 
<a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> spoke
about how her children have benefited enormously in past from IMYM youth programming. 
<a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> is happy
to volunteer to run a session slow parenting programming at IMYM. We as a meeting strongly
support IMYM youth program with young friends of the meeting having benefit. Friends 
are encouraged to send any thoughts to <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Would we like to hold a workshop on the Doctrine of Discovery? </p>
<p>Boulder meeting is available to conduct workshops on the Doctrine of 
Discovery and Indigenous People's rights.  Friends should know that 
there may be a minute about the Doctrine of Discovery proposed for 
June Gathering and meetings are encouraged to learn about it and schedule time for 
the powerful workshop Boulder can provide.</p>
<p>Please note: There are 4 attachments dealing with this issue in more 
detail, along with the proposed minute.       </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> suggests that this program would be of interest to the 
larger Colorado Springs community groups and religious organizations but she
doesn't feel called to organize the session. This idea will be seasoned and
brought up at next Meeting for Worship.   </p>
