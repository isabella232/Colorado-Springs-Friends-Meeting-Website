   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   <h1>Meeting for Worship for Business Minutes</h1>
<p>Present: <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer/">Carlton Gamer</a>, <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland/">Genie
Durland</a>, <a href="/Friends/BillDurland/">Bill Durland</a>,
<a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah Callbeck</a>, <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty/">Ann
Daugherty</a>, <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly
Wingate</a> (clerk), and <a href="/Friends/LisaLister/">Lisa
Lister</a> (Acting Recording Clerk).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Clerk read queries from Fort Collins Friends Newsletter, Oct.,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The following queries were read (from IMYM Faith and Practice,
pages 117-119), which prompted Bill to propose that M&amp;O further
explore vocal ministry, and perhaps facilitate a discussion with the
wider Meeting:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When in meeting for worship, do I clear my mind so that the
    Spirit has a place to enter?</p>
</li>
<li>Do I wait in great expectancy for the Spirit to speak - through
    me or through another?</li>
<li>Do I put my trust in the still small voice that I may hear?</li>
<li>How do I discern the source of a leading?</li>
<li>How do I know when to speak?</li>
<li>Do I hold myself back when moved to speak, or do I trust in the
    Light to lead me?</li>
<li>Am I careful not to speak at undue length or beyond my light?</li>
<li>Am I aware of a sense of "rightness" after I speak?</li>
<li>Does attendance at meeting for worship strengthen my spirit for
    the week ahead?</li>
<li>What brings me back to center - back to inner wisdom, home to
    myself - and how can I make that a regular practice?</li>
</ol>
<p>The October Minutes were accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cash Flow Reports, which were presented by Sarah (attached).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clerk's Report. We will hold our first Show and Tell on Friday,
    November 23 from 5-7 PM at the meeting house. Please bring a dish to
    share perhaps some Thanksgiving leftovers.
    <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer/">Carlton</a> will begin showing and telling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COMMITTEE REPORTS</p>
<p>a.  Finance Committee report is attached.
    <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> has been setting up our
    finances in QuickBooks. This has been taking some time and
    tweaking. Brian is setting up our tax-exempt status.
    <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> reviewed the draft budget for
    2013-the final budget will be presented at the December business
    meeting. We also looked at the new Balance Sheet and a Revenue
    Statement output from QuickBooks to make sure we were
    comfortable with these new report layouts and content. We are
    all thankful for <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> 's hard work,
    and the Finance Committee report was accepted with deep
    gratitude.</p>
<p>b.  Nominating Committee report was given by
    <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland/">Genie</a>. <a href="/Friends/BillWerling/">Bill
    Werling</a> and <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland/">Genie
    Durland</a> are on the Nominating
    Committee. They may be contacting people about their willingness
    to serve.</p>
<pre><code>ACTION: We approved Ann Martin as a member of M&amp;O.
</code></pre>
<p>c.  Ministry and Oversight report was given by
    <a href="/Friends/BillDurland/">Bill</a> and accepted with thanks. They
    discussed the greeting of visitors and how to be of support to
    <a href="/Friends/JonathanMcPhee/">Jonathan McPhee</a>.</p>
<pre><code>The full report is attached.
</code></pre>
<p>d.  First Day School Committee. There is no written report, but the
    First Day School children will be painting a mural downstairs
    during our next work day, November 25.
    <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> will be the adult presence.</p>
<p>e.  Adult Education and Action Committee (Two items)</p>
<pre><code>1.  ITEM 1: Molly read a minute on divestment which was drafted
    by Genie, and is before us for consideration:

    "We, Colorado Springs Friends Meeting, Religious Society of
    Friends, embrace the spirit and support the goals of the We
    Divest Campaign of the American Friends Service Committee.

    We understand that this campaign was launched in partnership
    with Jewish Voice for Peace and that it demands that
    TIAA-CREF stop investing in corporations that enable the
    destruction of Palestinian homes and orchards, the expansion
    of Israeli settlements and infrastructure, checkpoint
    surveillance of Palestinian communities, and provide weapons
    used against civilians. The campaign does not ask people to
    directly divest from TIAA-CREF. Rather it organizes
    retirement fund recipients to exercise their rights as
    shareholders and witness to TIAA-CREF (a company with \$441
    billion in assets) to divest from corporations that profit
    from the military occupation.

    As Friends who value our testimonies of Peace, Equality,
    Community, Integrity and Simplicity and strive to live by
    them, we unite with the AFSC campaign. We see the campaign
    as an example of speaking truth to power - in this case to
    the power of unjust profit - both as individuals and as a
    Meeting. We recognize that peace in the Middle East is
    dependent upon true justice for Palestinians and so seek to
    support all nonviolent efforts to further that cause."

    ACTION: This minute was approved by the Meeting. Genie will
    let AFSC and IMYM know that we have approved this minute.

2.  ITEM 2: Coloradans Against the Death Penalty support: Molly
    read the "Resolution of Support and Organizational
    Membership" sent to us from the Coloradans for Alternatives
    to the Death Penalty:

    "WHEREAS, the death penalty diverts millions of dollars a
    year of state resources into an arbitrary, unreliable,
    wasteful and unnecessary capital punishment system, and

    WHEREAS, the death penalty does not deter crime; and

    WHEREAS, the death penalty is imposed in an arbitrary and
    discriminatory manner;

    WHEREAS, there are a growing number of known cases of
    wrongful conviction and increasing evidence that there have
    been wrongful executions; and

    WHEREAS, the death penalty prolongs pain for victims'
    families, dragging them through an agonizing and lengthy
    process that holds out the promise of an execution at the
    beginning but often results in a different sentence in the
    end; and

    WHEREAS, our communities require the best protection and
    convicted murderers must be severely punished; and

    WHEREAS, in the state of Colorado, there are two possible
    sentences for Capital Murder; life without the possibility
    of parole and death. We agree that death should not be an
    option and, therefore, the sentence would be life without
    the possibility of parole.

    THEREFORE, we join the Coloradoans for Alternatives to the
    Death Penalty and others in publicly supporting legislation
    that abolishes the death penalty in our state. We recognize
    that the sole mission of the Coalition is to repeal the
    death penalty in Colorado. We understand that our
    organization will be listed as a member of the Coalition and
    agree to inform our members of our participation and invite
    them to be active in the campaign as part of our efforts
    and/or those of the Coalition or another member
    organization. We acknowledge our right to participate, or to
    not participate, in the meetings and decisions of the
    Coalition. We recognize that any resource implications
    involved in joining the Coalition are entirely voluntary."

    ACTION: We approved signing the resolution letter. We
    suggested that M&amp;O look at this issue and explore further if
    they believe the Meeting should write its own minute.

<p>b. Do we need a "steward" of the building? ACTION: Nominating Committee
will talk to Peter about the role of this person, and the committee will
draw up a list of responsibilities of this person. NEW BUSINESS a)
Colorado Springs will be the host of the spring gathering of Colorado
Regional Meeting April 28th, 2013, so we will need to think about making
some preparations.</p>
<p>b) A Quaker family from Durango Monthly Meeting will be here on Sunday,
December 9 to worship with us. Their daughter, age 19, is functionally
deaf and they are planning for her to matriculate for one semester at
the State School here in Colorado Springs. They are hopeful of finding
local Quakers to provide support for their daughter and have asked if
there is a family or individual in our meeting who would consider
hosting her for one or two weekends a month between January and May.
ACTION: Bill Wherling's family has volunteered to host this student. We
all think this is wonderful.</p>

monetary gift, which we have agreed to continue on a regular basis.</p>
