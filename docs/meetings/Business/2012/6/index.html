   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<li>
<p>Open Worship in Silence 11:42am</p>
<p>Thinking this morning of the practice of graditute, power spiritual
practice around perspective. How does it relate to Friends
testimonies? Most obvious answer to Ginger graditute supports
simplicity. An acknowledgement of what is good, a letting go of what
we don't have, kind of craving that Buddhist. Graditute for what is
good. Never made that connection, associated with graditute new age
or 12 steps programs, new insight on how graditute supports
simplicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval of May minutes Yes, any corrections or concerns? Meeting
    approves and accepts the Minutes for fifth month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash Flow Report Questions or clarifications? Beginning balance in
    May \$3,544.27, deposited in May \$586.03, transfer of \$5,656.97
    from Susan B. Anthony fund. Total outlays of \$12,637.65. Present
    balance 3,074.62.</p>
<p>Emergency Reserve ENT Credit Union \$532.83, other reserves at ENT
is 59.76. Current balance is 2,842.65. Reserve Fund at Friends
Fiduciary is 2,715.26. \$305 in donations to General Fund and \$75
for Building Fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Committee Reports:</p>
<p>a.  Finance Committee</p>
<pre><code>i.  Revised budget update

    The main reason to revise the budget was the new meeting
    house. Need to set certain set aside for insurance. The
    mortgage is a new account. Waiting for amortization schedule
    from the lender, other new accounts are maintenance account,
    hospitality supplies \$100, utilities \$175 a month based on
    actual cost.

    Finance committee report we are on track up-to-date, pledges
    and amount. We have a projected shortfall of \$4,000
    incoming although we have a prudent reserve to cover. We
    need to start figuring out to bring in more funds from
    renting out space and/or increase in donations. Increase of
    expenses include additional \$500 accounting services.

    Deepest graditute and especially to
    [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/).

ii. Dispersement recommendations

    Local distribution of \$100.00 with the updated list. New
    Foundations Nonviolence Center hasn't had a donation since
    Feb 2008. Facility workshops in Canon City. Good training
    for nonviolence. A lot of organizations that provide food,
    food supplies are running low. Food donations decrease in
    the summer. We have never given to Silver Key food bank.
    Ecumenical Services Ministries might know where need is
    greatest, they provide additional information on their
    services. Care &amp; Share Food bank provides, split \$100,
    50/50 between Silver Key and Care &amp; Share.
</code></pre>
<p>b.  Nominating Committee</p>
<pre><code>i.  Replacement for [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/),
    [Jonathan](/Friends/JonathanMcPhee/) and
    [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) current members.
    [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) is standing down as she
    assumes Clerk duties. [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/)
    service is opportunity for spiritual growth and service.
    Spirit will move. What is the charge of the Nominating
    Committee? Find Friends to fulfill and match talents and
    experiences with opportunities for services. Let
    [Jonathan](/Friends/JonathanMcPhee/) know if you are
    interested. Question, can you have a committee with just one
    member? No, also committee member needs to be able to attend
    meeting.
</code></pre>
<p>c.  Ministry and Oversight</p>
<pre><code>i.  [Val Phillips](/Friends/ValPhillips/) transfer of
    membership. [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/) wants to transfer
    her membership from Mountain Friends to Colorado Springs
    Meeting. She lives in Gardner, with intentional community
    and organic farms, not only Quakers there is a worship group
    under care of the Mountain Friends Meeting.

    M&amp;O hasn't had a clearness committee with
    [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/) but she has expressed interest.
    Need to have a clearness committee to see the way clear for
    both [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/) and our meeting.
    [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) can schedule a clearness
    committee for [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/) to transfer,
    [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) and
    [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/) will come up with the clearness
    committee. M&amp;O will make recommendation if they find
    clearness to transfer [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/)'s
    membership.

ii. Gardner Worship Group Request for care of Gardner Worship
    Group, does the Colorado Springs Meeting have the capacity
    for this? [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/),
    [Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/), and
    [Nancy](/Friends/NancyAndrew/). Does Colorado Springs
    Meeting have the ability to nurture the Worship Group to
    become a full Monthly Meeting.

    It would be advisability if Colorado Springs Meeting worship
    with Gardner Worship Group.

    Transfer of [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/)'s membership is the
    first step towards accepting care for Gardner Worship Group
    by Meeting. Expectations of Monthly Meeting towards Worship
    Groups under its care.

iii. Memorial for Dede Martha has been contact with Dede's
    daughter Jennifer. She and her family are just doing one
    gathering on the 24th at Margirtias. When
    [Martha](/Friends/MarthaLutz/) knows the exact time, she
    will forward announcement to Meeting.

iv. M&amp;O has a discretionary funds for Philip Brasfield
    contribution.

v.  Meeting recommends that M&amp;O use Faith and Practice mission
    statement. M&amp;O work on calendar of requirements and process
    during the year. Incoming clerk request to all committees
    that they know their responsibilities, reports including
    State of Meeting report, census, and membership.

    Hope to finish with yearly contact of meetings members and
    attenders.
</code></pre>
<p>d.  Meeting House</p>
<pre><code>i.  Work days at meeting house, easiest if Work Day is after the
    forth first day after meeting.

ii. Roof repair, things weren't as seemed, seller's insurance
    company will only replace the Westside of the roof. For
    another \$1,000 we can get a whole new roof. We are
    receiving \$6,083 from Seller's insurance, cost \$8,800.43
    to replace the whole root. Don't think they need to replace
    wood shake singles. Remove two layers of asphalt shingles
    and first plywood.

    Two things that are pending; hail damage price increase for
    supplies. Ginger needs copies of contract. Finance committee
    approves. What about other bids? Biggest issue is the
    steepness of the roof, many roofing contractors would not
    provide bid due to liability.

    Might start in the next week or two if contract is signed.
    Include new East side gutter. Could the Meetinghouse
    Committee with the Finance committee coordinate agree to
    move forward with guttering? Seamless gutters? Yes. Sense of
    the meeting to give Meetinghouse and Finance approval go
    ahead to move forward about replacement and adding gutters
    and report back to the Meeting.

iii. Heater repair Got a bid about fixing furnace? Can we live
    with just one heater? One won't light. Need more
    investigation. Is there a way for someone to look at
    non-working furnace. One challenge is that due to the age of
    the heaters is parts are available. Can heater be repaired
    easily? All duct work with 90% efficiency furnace is \$8k,
    additional \$3k for Air Conditioning. Not sure if we need
    AC. Clarification, two things will happen.

    1.  hire expert to see about repairing existing furnace.

    2.  [Jennifer](/Friends/JenniferRoberts/) will investigate
        alternative.

    3.  If repair is under \$200, then move forward out of
        renovation fund or furnace prudent reserve.

    What about plumbing? The plumbing in the bathrooms are
    protected with individual heaters.

iv. [Daniel](/Friends/DanielKidney/) looking at fixing loose
    light and will work on a temporary solution to open the
    windows in the basement. [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) will
    work on electric outlets and heaters in the basement.

    Question about hanging up bulletin board? Consider options.

    Recommend the formation of Grounds subcommittee to focus on
    outside, Meetinghouse committee focus on building. Sit with
    recommendation about the Grounds? Don't know if this needs
    another committee.

    Big tree not being watered. During work day, to run hose
    figure out how to water during Meeting.
</code></pre>
<p>e.  First Day School Committee</p>
<pre><code>Wanting to revisit the schedule and strategy for First Day
School? Best way to get in touch with Jon? Ginger will be
following up.
</code></pre>
<p>f.  Adult Religious Education and Action Committee</p>

Meetinghouse. Send suggestions to [Ann
Margret](/Friends/AnnGrantMargret/) for contacting and

    bookshelves in the Meeting.

<p>c.  Friends Mountain Camp Queries from IMYM</p>
<p>d.  Resignation of Clerk</p>
<p>e.  Greeters for Meeting for Worship</p>
<pre><code>[Martha](/Friends/MarthaLutz/) good idea, helper for new
attenders, willing to do it one time month. Might fall under M&amp;O
and Meeting coordinate greeters with
[Maria](/Friends/MariaMelendez/). Mixed reactions, both positive
and negative about use of name-tags. Friends who are interested
to be greeters should contact [Maria](/Friends/MariaMelendez/).
Ask M&amp;O to come up with procedures for handling latecomers.
</code></pre>
<p>f.  Philip Brasfield contribution</p>
