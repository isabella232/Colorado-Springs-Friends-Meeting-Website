   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p><a href="/Friends/GingerMorgan/">Ginger Morgan</a> began at 11:20 with the
    following reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been moved by an inbreaking of the Light -- awakened
by the inflowing love of God? Even a very small experience of
something deep and holy can make you want to find the Light again.
If you are fortunate enough to have had many of these experiences,
or even a few profound ones, you know how much it is worth trying
to align your life to keep open a channel to God's Living
Presence.</p>
<p>From Expectant Listening: Finding God's Thread of Guidance by
Michael Wajda. Pendle Hill Pamphlet 388</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Approval of <a href="/meetings/Business/2011/12/10/Minutes">December
    Minutes</a> with the following
    addition:</p>
<p>In the <a href="/committees/Nominating/">Nominating Committee</a> Report:
Please add <a href="/Friends/JulieRoten-Valdez/">Julie Roten-Valdez</a> on to
Meeting Home Committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash Flow Report and Year End Financial Statements Report All
    accounts at Wells Fargo are closed! We have an unusually high
    checking account balance because we are about to pay our yearly
    assessments to <a href="/ColoradoRegionalMeeting/">Colorado Regional
    Meeting</a> and <a href="/imym/">Intermountain Yearly
    Meeting</a>.</p>
<p>In savings, we currently have our emergency fund as part of the
savings accounts. <a href="/committees/Finance/">Finance Committee</a> will
think about whether we need a separate account for the emergency
fund. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> presented the Cash Flow
Report, the December Balance Sheet, and the Revenue Statement for
2011. She pointed out that the <a href="/committees/Finance/">finance
committee</a> is establishing reserve accounts
for the library and for <a href="/committees/FirstDay/">First Day School</a> so
that any money not spent in one year will carrying over and be
available the next year.</p>
<p>All reports were accepted with gratitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Committee Reports:</p>
<p>a.  <a href="/committees/Finance/">Finance Committee</a></p>
<pre><code>&gt; i.  The Committee brought a question for the Meeting regarding
&gt;     amount and frequency of financial reporting and financial
&gt;     business: how often, what, and how much do we address each
&gt;     month?
&gt;
&gt;     A full discussion ensued. [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/)
&gt;     provided a list of reports presented in a year. We came to
&gt;     clarity that we would like the reports to come to the
&gt;     meeting as they have, but to encourage members and
&gt;     attenders to review the financial reports in advance and
&gt;     bring their questions. That way,
&gt;     [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) will be able to limit her
&gt;     comments during meeting for business to the bottom lines,
&gt;     to unusual financial happenings, and to questions.
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>b.  Updated <a href="/committees/Nominating/">Nominating Committee</a> report:</p>
<pre><code>1.  [Nancy Andrew](/Friends/NancyAndrew/) is nominated to be our
    meeting's representative to [IMYM Continuing
    Committee](/imym/committees/Continuing) June 2012 through
    June 2014. Meeting approved.

2.  Nominate [Julie Roten-Valdez](/Friends/JulieRoten-Valdez/)
    to Meeting Home Committee. Meeting approved.

3.  Nominate [Bill Durland](/Friends/BillDurland/) to [Ministry
    and Oversight](/committees/M&amp;O/). Meeting approved.
    [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) will call one more meeting
    of [M&amp;O](/committees/M&amp;O/) to assure a smooth transition.
</code></pre>
<p>c.  <a href="/committees/M&amp;O/">Ministry and Oversight</a></p>
<pre><code>1.  Deb Gimpelson's request for Transfer of Membership. She is
    attending meeting in New Zealand and is considering
    transferring her membership.
    [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) asked if there were any
    concerns. Finding none, [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/)
    will continue the process of transfer with all care and
    love.

2.  Update on Jennifer Roberts and remembering / honoring
    [Tup](/Friends/TupRoberts/). Jennifer reports that her
    brothers have had an event to remember
    [Tup](/Friends/TupRoberts/). Jennifer is still caught up
    with the financial stuff of settling
    [Tup](/Friends/TupRoberts/)'s estate, and when she is on the
    other side of the finances she will contact us. Friends may
    feel moved to have a memorial for
    [Tup](/Friends/TupRoberts/) and would be sure to include
    Jennifer in any plans.

3.  Charge to reconsider whether reinstituting

    [Religious Education and Action](/committees/rea) committee
    would serve our Meeting. [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/)
    raised the question of whether the REA\_ committee will
    oversee adult education and action as well as first day
    school. [M&amp;O](/committees/M&amp;O/) might consider this
    question, but he would like to hear from the meeting as
    well. [Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/) noted that if we do
    reconstitute the REA\_, she would be willing to clerk the
    adult education part. We came to the conclusion that we
    would ask [M&amp;O](/committees/M&amp;O/) to put together a charge
    for REA\_.

    There may be those who feel called to serve on [Religious
    Education and Action](/committees/rea) Committee or to help
    create a charge for the committee with a range of activities
    for adult education and conversation. Those interested speak
    to [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) or
    [Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/).

<p>a.  Follow up from Lessons Learned. The
    <a href="/minutes/2012/01/special">minutes</a> were approved.
    <a href="/Friends/GingerMorgan/">Ginger</a> suggested that we consider
    scheduling Soup and Sharing or Potluck Sharing on preparedness
    and Quaker testimonies as raised by Lessons Learned Meeting
    regarding acquisition of Meeting Home. She asked, Are there
    other outcomes from this meeting to discuss as we find our way
    forward?.</p>
<pre><code>Please add to the minutes of the special meeting that the song
at the end of the gathering was [Sweet, Sweet
Spirit](..%20_`REA`:%20/committees/rea). We were reminded that
we wanted to have some intentional conversations as a meeting
about being ready and proceeding in the process of finding a
home for the meeting.

[Bill Durland](/Friends/BillDurland/) remarked on the value
and importance of having a good record of the conversation and
thanked [Molly Wingate](/Friends/MollyWingate/) for her work.
[Genie Durland](/Friends/GenieDurland/) pointed out that she
would like to focus next winter's adult education class on the
[testimonies](/testimonies/), and she thought this discussion
might help with the question of a meeting house.

[Molly Wingate](/Friends/MollyWingate/) asked that we have
conversation about renting a space. The more she has thought
of it, the better the idea of renting sounds.

[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) asked if we should have the
next potluck on the question of renting.
[Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) asked
[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) to craft a query for the
discussion that includes the idea of growth and being
*evangelical and significant in our community*.

[Sarah Callbeck](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) reminded us of the
comment that discerning who we are as a meeting and what our
identity is will inform what sort of edifice we will inhabit.
Just wanting a meeting house is not quite enough to get us in
one, and finding out who we are might help us get there.

[Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/) added that getting a place
would help us express ourselves and find out who we are.

[Joyce Doyle](/Friends/JoyceDoyle/) concurred that there needs
to be a clearer sense of a **mission statement** for why we
exist, and she is interested in the action of the meeting. She
feels we are missing a clear sense of why this particular
meeting exists. She is encouraged that she is hearing the
words and ideas she has been waiting for.

[Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) pointed out the challenge of
talking about what we are before we act. It is easy to have a
great and important conversation but have it not result in
action.

[Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/) pointed out the challenge of
Quakerism inclusiveness and having a specific identity.

[Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) talked about how her identity
as a [Friend](/ReligiousSocietyOfFriends) has been a
reflection of what is going on in the world and how she has
engaged in it. She commented that the continual unfolding of
God's message and direction are central to
[Quakerism](/ReligiousSocietyOfFriends) and thus
[Quakerism](/ReligiousSocietyOfFriends) changes.

[Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) pointed out that
[testimonies](/testimonies/) are the things that we can all
agree with and they are a foundation for our identity. He
urged us to come to an understanding of who we are
individually and have a regular conversation about each of us.
He agreed that we can use the [testimonies](/testimonies/) to
find the kind of building we want to be in. He talked about us
a [Hicksite Friends](/history/Hicksite) and how we differ from
the [Friends Church](/locations/FriendsChurch). This question
was not adequately addressed in other meetings and lead to a
permanent split. [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) suggested
that we have a series of conversations where one Friend
addresses how they became
[Quakers](/ReligiousSocietyOfFriends), what being a
[Quaker](/ReligiousSocietyOfFriends) means to them, and how
their lives reflect their
[Quakerism](/ReligiousSocietyOfFriends).

We generally agreed that it would be a great to have such
discussions. So what steps do we take to ensure this happens.
Use the next potluck for one person to tell his/her story or
use the potluck for planning?

[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) pulled us back from the
conversation to say that she will hold all these ideas and get
back to us about the next potluck.

We had silence.
