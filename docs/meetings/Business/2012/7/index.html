   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<li>
<p>Approval of June Minutes - approved with changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash Flow Reports</p>
<p>Reports distributed 7/11. Clerk asked if there is preference for how
cash flow report is read at Business Meeting, full report or
highlights? We encouraged finance clerk just related the highlight
and it is not necessary to read entire report.</p>
<p>Pretty unanimous among Friends, redirect all funds targeted to
building fund to general fund. Current ending balance at the end of
June. \$3,294.74 cents in checking account. At the moment we are
trending water and holding stable.</p>
<p>Small building fund deposit portion to pledge, the current total
savings includes emergency reserves \$2,907.89. The amount remaining
in the building fund, a Ent saving \$2,314.53, 1,400 left of Meeting
House projects, roof payment. Sarah took all contributions to
building funds at the end of April are all. Prudent reserve, some
money has gone into the building fund, difference between 2,300 and
1,400 is mortgage reserve. We have \$400 dollars left over for
building house projects. We are still buying supplies. After July's
expenses, likely down to 300 for Building House fund. We are always
going to try to keep about \$10,000 in prudent emergency reserves.</p>
<p>Molly would like to celebrate the fact that two major issues for the
Meeting House, the roof and the furnace, pause and reflect how great
it is that we as the small Meeting able to support.</p>
<p>The Meeting accepts the cash flow with gratitude.</p>

out the [finance committee report]. Any number of issues
surrounding renting out Meeting House reports, Meeting House
committee also discussed. [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/)
thoughts we are not ready to rent, until we have up to code and
safe heat in the bathrooms, we are not ready for renting. There
are sorts of things we are involved that we could bring meetings
here. We don't have the storage capacity to support renting out
space. Encourage Friends to how we can use the Meeting House for
our events? We don't have enough chairs to support,
[Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) so thankful to
[Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) about keeping this issue
mindful.

<p>a.  Greeters for meeting/ arrangements for late comers to meeting
    for worship. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> feels that right
    now we don't have problem, still keep this matter to discuss?
    <a href="/Friends/JoyceDoyle/">Joyce</a> wonders if Friend coming to the
    door and sit at outside of meeting. Ad hoc, easy solution, pass
    responsibility around over time. Super easy to do, and not have
    long-term commitment. Maybe week-by-week or monthly. Sign on
    "greeter chair", striving for simplicity.
    <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> doesn't have a problem with more
    of a long term commitment likes the idea of greeter. Concern or
