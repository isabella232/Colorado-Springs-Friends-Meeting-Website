   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>Meeting opened in silence. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> are
    meetings for worship for business, considered the following queries
    from the Fort Collins Friends Newsletter</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are our monthly meetings held in the spirit of a meeting for
    worship in which we, in love and mutual respect, seek divine
    guidance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How effectively do members of the meeting temper and strengthen
    individuals our meetings for business lead to a corporate search
    for and revelation of the Light?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As difficult problems arise, are we careful to meet them in a
    spirit of love and humility with minds receptive to creative
    solutions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we avoid pressure of time, neither unnecessarily prolonging
    nor unduly full discussion?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Approval of November Minutes, thanks Lisa for taking minutes. The
    meeting approved the minutes.</p>

<p>Cash Flow Reports. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> presented,
    nothing particular remarkable in the checking account. Try to keep

    The other amount was other money designated for the building fund as
    a result of pledge letters. \$6,000 in building fund, total building
    \$16,419.21, does not include checking.
    <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> asked about if the \$6,000 included
    in \$16,419.21? <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> replied that the
    \$16,000 does not include the building fund. Approved by the
    Meeting.</p>

<p>Committee Reports:</p>
<p>a.  Finance Committee - reports sent out.
    <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> sent around a job description
    of the for the bookkeeper's part-time position.
    <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> putting in financial
    information into the QuickBooks, keeping this updated will be
    easier than she thought. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> will
    accept the bookkeeper's position upon the recommendation of the
    Lisa and Ann. She will just accept what is on the sheet and keep
    within in the budget. Meeting wholeheartedly agreed and welcome
    <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> to her new role.</p>
<pre><code>The Finance Committee seeks approval of the proposed 2012-2013
budget. At this point 12,000 pledged for 2013, we are in process
of paying down that will affect the cash flow including the
mortgage and insurance reserve. Insurance is on the budget
twice; once for the reserve and the bookkeeping entry. We made
it through 2012, with only \$2,000 deficit for 2013.
[Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) thanks Finance committee for the
proposed budget, it looks like the Meeting will be able to stay
within the budget. [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) also noted
that we have been under \$175 for \$176.30 deficit per month,
[Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) hopes that we can make that in
rental income. Budget approved with appreciation for all the
Finance Committee's hard work.

Striving for a six month mortgage and utilities permanent
reserve. Trying to keep \$2,000 checking balance. Reminds
members and attenders that at end of year donation.

Foundations, proposed we send \$25

<p>d.  First Day School Committee - No Report.</p>
<p>e.  Adult Education and Action Committee - Announcement of the
    change of schedule. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> has put up a
    change jar the Mesa House.</p>
<p>f.  Meeting Home</p>
<pre><code>1.  Report about replacing the heater.
    [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) had an eMeeting with the
    Finance Committee. What we expected in saving would take a 7
    years to be offset costs. Two options were explored with 92%
    efficient furnace. With support of Finance Committee will
    dip into reserve funds. With concern expressed about the
    carbon footprint of A/C, Meeting Home recommends to just
    install new furnace with new insulation and ceiling fans. We
    may revisit this decision if lack of A/C detracts from
    renting Meeting House in the summer and may apply for
    further grant. Discussed were characteristics of fans
    including placement, appearances, and silence.

    Does the Meeting trust the Meeting Home to make decisions
    regarding the furnace, fans, etc.?

    Hoping that any kind of furnace make a point to the
    installer that we prefer less noise the better. This can be
    a problem. Acoustics... Question about the need for A/C?
    Last summer, the temperature was uncomfortable. This may
    change with ceiling fans and insulation. Friends come to
    consensus that we should proceed with the 92% furnace, with
    insulation and fans. Thermostat and a timer for new furnace
    to minimize use during meeting for worship. Meeting Home
    will proceed immediately, [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) will
    contact electric, furnace, and insulation bid, heating and
    wiring as soon as possible. Approved.

<pre><code>"One Meeting Clerk has asked me if it's ok to forward the
electronic copies to everyone on her Meeting email list.
Although this has not been discussed at Continuing Committee, I
suggested to her that that was not a good idea; it might be
interpreted as 'okaying' general distribution to those not
members or active attenders of Meetings. I suggested instead
that we only send it to individuals in each Meeting who request
it."

Ed Kearns, Chair, IMYM Directory Committee

[Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/) requested a copy of the
