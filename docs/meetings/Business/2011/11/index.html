   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   <h1>Minutes for Meeting for Worship for Business</h1>
<h2>November 13, 2011</h2>
<p>In attendance: <a href="/Friends/LindaSeger/">Linda Seger</a>, <a href="/Friends/BillWerling">Bill
Werling</a>, <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson/">Jeremy Nelson</a>,
Lisa Lister, <a href="/Friends/JoyceDoyle/">Joyce Doyle</a>, <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland/">Genie
Durland</a>, <a href="/Friends/BillDurland/">Bill Durland</a>,
<a href="/Friends/GingerMorgan/">Ginger Morgan</a>, <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah
Callbeck</a>, <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer/">Carlton
Gamer</a> (clerk), <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly
Wingate</a> (recording clerk)</p>
<p>We opened at 11:20 with a John Woolman reading from 1772:</p>
<pre><code>There is a principal which is pure, placed in the human minds, which
in different places and ages hath had different names. It is, however,
pure and proceeds from God. It is deep and inward, confined to no
forms of religion, nor excluded from any, where the heart stands in
perfect sincerity. In whomsoever this takes root and grows, of what
nation soever, they become brethren in the best sense of the
expression.
</code></pre>
<p>Followed by silence.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Approval of October Minutes - attached. Accepted with thanks to
    <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson/">Jeremy Nelson</a> for standing in for <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly
    Wingate</a>.</p>

<p>Cash Flow Report : see Finance Committee report (e)</p>
</li>

<p>Committee Reports:
    a.  <strong>Finance Committee</strong></p>
<pre><code>1.  A concern about Friends Journal subscription. They have
    raised their rate. Conversation ensued about how we use
    the resource. We decided that we will subscribe to
    Friends Journal for two years for \$90, which will be
    \$12 over budget.

2.  A concern about changing the schedule for business
    meeting so that we can have the cash flow reports for
    business meeting. Conversation ensued about shifting the
    meeting's schedule. We also discussed the issues
    involved in not having the most accurate financial
    information at meeting for worship for business. We
    decided to find out how the move would affect the [Adult
    Education](/committees/REA) class and then decide at the
    next meeting for business if we can move to the third
    Sunday starting in January 2012.

3.  Sarah presented the need for the meeting to hire out
    bookkeeper services. We approved seeking out and paying
    for a bookkeeper.

4.  Draft budget discussion. We have a few additional budget
    lines this year for a bookkeeper and bank charges.

    a.  The bookkeeper charge is split between the general
        fund (2/3) and building fund (1/3). If there is a
        need to draw more money out of the building fund to
        pay for the bookkeeper, the meeting would like to
        leave that decision to the Finance Committee without
        bringing it to business meeting.

    b.  Bank charges are a new line item to cover fees
        charged by Paypal (3.4%) for donations that come in
        through our website. The charges are split between
        the building and general fund because the donations
        which accrue these charges are split between the
        funds.

5.  The building fund was explained with few questions
    asked.

6.  The draft budget was accepted with gratitude and we look
    forward to the final budget at the December meeting
    2011.

7.  [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) presented the September
    and October cash flow reports. These reports are
    attached. The gist of the reports is that we can close
    out the Wells Fargo accounts and do all of our business
    with ENT Credit Union.

    The finance committee is considering setting up some
    other reserve accounts. We are operating well.

8.  [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) presented the revenue
    and balance sheets for the third quarter of 2011. They
    are attached. The reports were accepted with gratitude.

9.  [Linda](/Friends/LindaSeger/) asked about what we do
    with extra money. Sarah explained that last year, the
    finance committee brought the issue of the budget
    surplus to the meeting for business. The meeting decided
    to add to what we donate to other organizations. If we
    have another surplus, they would do the same.
</code></pre>
<p>b.  <strong>Nominating Committee</strong></p>
<pre><code>1.  Approved [Molly Wingate](/Friends/MollyWingate/) to
    serve on the Colorado Regional Meeting's Nominating
    Committee.

2.  Please note that [Bill Werling](/Friends/BillWerling) is
    serving at the CRM representative to the IMYM Committee
    on Suffering.

3.  Several positions for the meeting will be coming open in
    January. They include clerk, recording clerk, and
    others. Please See [Genie
    Durland](/Friends/GenieDurland/) or [Julie
    Roten-Valdez](/Friends/JulieRoten-Valdez/) if you wish
    to volunteer. We hope to approve the new service
    positions at the December meeting.
</code></pre>
<p>c.  <strong>Ministry and Oversight</strong></p>
<pre><code>Report on Clearness Committee re: transfer of [Jeremy Nelson](/Friends/JeremyNelson/)'s 
membership from [Salt Lake Meeting](http://www.saltlakequakers.org/) to Colorado
Springs. Business meeting approved the transfer of
membership. December potluck will be a welcome for [Jeremy Nelson](/Friends/JeremyNelson/).

Ministry and Oversight is willing to expand their membership
as Friends are lead. They invite anyone interested to
contact [Linda](/Friends/LindaSeger/),
[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/), or
[Martha](/Friends/MarthaLutz/).

[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) brought to our attention an
observation that we are uneven in our welcoming new
attenders. We are urged to extend ourselves a bit in
welcoming new folks. We had a discussion of how we may order
our closing of meeting so that new people have a chance to
introduce themselves. [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/)
pointed out that the informal welcoming is what provoked the
observation. [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) and
Lisa](/Friends/LisaLister/) suggested that we shake hands
at the break of meeting. We asked [ministry and
oversight](/committees/MinistryAndOversight/) talk about the
breaking of meeting and bring us suggestions.

[M &amp; O](/committees/MinistryAndOversight/) will follow up
with Pueblo friends to see if we can be of service to them.

They will also follow up with regular attenders as they make
their annual calls to see how everyone is doing.

[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) announced that she is
willing to clerk a debrief of the lessons learned when
trying to buy the building at 15 S. Wahsatch.
</code></pre>
<p>d.  <strong>Education Committee</strong></p>
<pre><code>A regular rotation of adults is needed to teach [First Day
School](/committees/Education). There are more Sundays than
there are teachers at this point, so please consider
teaching a lesson a month or at least supervising "Game Day"
on the second Sunday of the month. Please contact [Molly
Wingate](/Friends/MollyWingate/) or [John
Gallagher](/Friends/JohnGallagher).
</code></pre>
<p>e.  <strong>Meeting Home</strong></p>
<pre><code>We had a discussion about having a discussion of lessons
learned from our process of trying to buy 15 S. Wahsatch.
The suggestion was for [Ministry and
Oversight](/committees/MinistryAndOversight/) to lead the
discussion. [Ginger Morgan](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) offered
to clerk it. She suggested that we pick a time after meeting
or an off time. She will send out a scheduler to find a time
for us to meet.
</code></pre>
<p>f.  <strong>Library</strong></p>
<pre><code>No report.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Old business</p>
<p>a.  Friends expressed interest in a discussion group about a book
    offered by FGC The Wisdom to Know the Difference by Eileen
    Flanagan. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> will order books and
    schedule a discussion time in January. Please contact her so
    she can order enough books. Those interested will contact
    <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a>.</p>
<p>b.  <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> will have queries from the
    IMYM documents concerning the IMYM Task Group Recommendations
    and FCNL representation ready in time for the December
    Potluck.</p>
<p>c.  Hospitality time after meeting and 1st Sunday potlucks remain
    Friendly times of fellowship.</p>
<p>d.  We returned to the question of the Sheii Koeii Quaker Farming
    Community near Gardner, CO and how we can support them.
    <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland/">Genie</a> suggested that the question is
    really for Mountain View to decide and then ask us.
    <a href="/Friends/BillDurland/">Bill</a> and
    <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland/">Genie</a> are not in a position to be
    the liaison to this group on a regular basis.</p>
<pre><code>There are several questions about the nature the group and
their request which [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) suggested
that Mountain View should take up.
[Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/) is happy to share the contact
information for Friends to visit the group. Meeting agreed.
</code></pre>
<p>e.  We returned to the Joint Statement on Palestine from AFSC,
    QUONW and FCNL that was brought to Friend's attention last
    month. <a href="/Friends/BillDurland/">Bill</a> clarified that this
    statement is not for our approval but for our information.
    <a href="/Friends/BillDurland/">Bill</a> discussed the issues of politics
    and spirituality in Quakers. We discussed an interest in
    having a soup and sharing on the topic of politics and
    religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Business</p>
<p>a.  Our noisy neighbors. The bar next door has begun opening at 10
    AM on Sundays. We have had only friendly contacts with
    employees and managers in an effort to reduce the level of the
    music during Meeting for Worship. All requests have been
    honored. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly</a> spoke to the manager
    during the week and explained our needs, and meeting was quiet
    on Sunday.</p>
<p>b.  <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer/">Carlton</a> and
    <a href="/Friends/GingerMorgan/">Ginger</a> are looking into the
    possibility of our moving on to Colorado College's campus, if
     we need or want to. We discussed the pros and cons.</p>
<p>c.  <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> reported that
    <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson/">Jeremy</a> has begun to look at the
    Meeting's website and he and Sarah will have some questions
    for the Meeting next month.</p>
<p>d.  <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck/">Sarah</a> also presented
    <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer/">Carlton</a> with the letter to send to
    Wells Fargo explaining that we are closing our accounts
    because of our beliefs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We closed at 2PM in silence.</p>
<p>Presented in the Light,</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate/">Molly Wingate</a></p>
