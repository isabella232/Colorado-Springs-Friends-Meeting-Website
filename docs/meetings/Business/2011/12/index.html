   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>For Friends the most important consideration is not the right action
 in itself but a right inward state out of which right action will
 arise. Given the right inward state, right action is inevitable.
 Inward state and outward action are component parts of a single whole.</p>

<pre><code> Since the proposed budget was presented, we have gotten more

 you, Friends, for supporting the Meeting. We are urged to
 remember that the travel budget line is not fixed. We can
 always rearrange the budget and find more, if needed. The 2012
 budget was approved.

 give \$100 to each.

     Committee

 Discussion ensued about the former Religious Education and
 Action Committee that has de facto withered.
 [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) mentioned that [Ministry and
 Oversight](/committees/MinistryAndOversight/) has talked about
 the spiritual health of the meeting and suggested that we
 discuss the ideas for religious education and action in a
 potluck. [Joyce](/Friends/JoyceDoyle/) added that she would
 welcome a focused action from Friends that would be part of
 our community. We discussed reinstituting the name of the
 [Religious Education and Action](/committees/REA/) Committee
 and adding the members and a charge later.

 We gratefully accepted the nominations as presented and we ask
 each committee to reflect on their configuration and what is
 needed to complete their charge. The [nomination
 committee](/committees/Nominating/) will work each committee
 to ensure that committee have what the personnel they need.
 [Ministry and Oversight](/committees/MinistryAndOversight/)
 will season the idea of Religious Education and Action
 Committee and bring that deliberation back to the meeting for
 consideration.

 We also approved [John Gallagher](/Friends/John%20Gallagher)
 to serve as our representative to the Colorado Regional
 Meeting's Continuing Committee.

<p>c.  <a href="/committees/MinistryAndOversight/">Ministry and Oversight</a></p>
<pre><code>[M&amp;O](/committees/MinistryAndOversight/) contacts all members in
inquire as to their affiliation with the meeting. There are some
who are, for better or worse, missing in action.
[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) asked for feedback about some
people. We may not have good contact information for Hal and Deb
Gimpelson in New Zealand. IN the case of Deneen Crandall, we
have lost track of where she is and haven't had any contact with
her, but we have gotten assessment money from her. Charles Stoy
was grateful for contact the meeting some years ago, but
[Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) has not gotten any response
from contacts him recently. [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/)
expressed that she is unclear about keeping Charles on the list
of members. We are concerned to proceed carefully and
thoughtfully. We urged [M&amp;O](/committees/MinistryAndOversight/)
to continue to try make contact, get updates from Deneen and
Charlie, and to get good contact information for Hal and Deb.

[Connie Williams](/Friends/ConnieWilliams/) wishes to stay
affiliated with our meeting, even though Buena Vista Worship
Group has been laid down. We approved the following minute.

 After communication with Connie Williams, we have learned that
 the Buena Vista Worship Groups is no longer meeting. [Colorado
 Springs Meeting](/) therefore lays down our care for that
 workshop group and retains [Connie](/Friends/ConnieWilliams/)
 as a member.

<p>d.  <a href="/committees/Education/">Education Committee</a></p>
<pre><code>We are thankful that [Jeremy Nelson](/Friends/JeremyNelson/) has
offered to help with [First Day School](/committees/Education/),
and we welcome anyone who wishes to join the ranks of teachers,
occasionally or on a regular basis.

<p>e.  <a href="/committees/MeetingHome">Meeting Home Committee</a></p>
<pre><code>We will be holding a special session to discuss lessons learned
from the process regarding 15 S. Wahsatch and to give the

Wednesday, December 14th from 5-7 PM at the Women's Club
building, 20 Mesa Road. We hope for a very good attendance.

<p>f.  Library -</p>

<p>a.  Yearly Meeting Queries/Discussion topics. We were asked to
    forward any comments to Continuing Committee concerning
    recommendations from the IMYM Structure Task Force and from the
    FCNL group; we need not come to unity on any of them. Below are
    the recommendations followed by our response to them.</p>
<pre><code>1.  Recommendations concerning the structure of IMYM from the
    Structure Task Force.

    **Recommendation 1.** IMYM 2011.06 Intermountain Yearly
    Meeting should continue to provide funds for travel when the
    representatives need assistance. The criteria for
    appointment should not include ability to pay for travel.
    Representatives should be able to request reimbursement for
    their actual travel expenses (rather than according to a
    schedule).

    We think this is a great idea. Absolutely essential.

    **Recommendation 2.** The Yearly Meeting should continue to
    appoint the current number of representatives to Western
    Friend (3) and Friends Peace Teams (1). FWCC, FCNL, AFSC,
    and FGC should be limited to no more than 3 representatives,
    and the representatives should be at large rather than
    representing the regions. Rather than simply attempting to
    fill all positions, the Yearly Meeting should instead
    appoint only representatives who feel a real leading to
    serve, leaving representative positions vacant if no one
    with such a leading can be found.

    We think the recommendation to have only at-large members
    may be too diffuse. We suggest that the committee ask for
    specific feedback from the current representatives to each
    organization and try again to reduce the costs. We also hope
    that we seek clarity about the financial responsibility of
    who supports this external travel, IMYM or the group to
    which we are sending representatives.

    **Recommendation 3.** To fund the growing need for financial
    aid to attend Annual Gathering, the Yearly Meeting should
    provide financial aid from the general fund by increasing
    Monthly Meeting assessments rather than increasing the cost
    of attending the Annual Gathering.

    We think that this is a good idea. The cost of IMYM should
    be kept within reach.

    **Recommendation 4.** The Yearly Meeting's operating budget
    is entirely funded by assessments from Monthly Meetings, and
    the Yearly Meeting is not organized to manage or oversee
    projects. In almost all cases, financial support for
    specific causes and donations to other organizations should
    continue to be a Monthly Meeting responsibility. However,
    the Yearly Meeting should also provide an orderly
    way, "preferably with full involvement by Monthly Meetings" for
    discerning whether the Yearly Meeting should support a
    specific concern or make a donation to another organization.

    We support that the Yearly Meeting seek a way forward to
    create an orderly method to consider financial support of
    causes and donations. We are also concerned, however, that
    the yearly meeting has an obligation to provide service and
    support to causes. We wish that IMYM structure itself in
    such a way that it will be able to extend itself.

    We would welcome the opportunity to consider these
    recommendations in light of recommendations from the
    Stewardship and Service Committees.

    They are most certainly going to impact each other.

2.  Number of representative from IMYM to FCNL.

    The Structure Task Force suggested that the number be
    reduced from 6 to 3. We are to weigh the attached comments
    and pass our comments on to IMYM. Please see our comments on
    recommendation 2.
