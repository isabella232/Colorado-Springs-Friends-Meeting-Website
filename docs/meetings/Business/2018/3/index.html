   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   <h1>MINUTES</h1>
<h2>Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business</h2>
<h2>Colorado Springs Friends Meeting</h2>
<p><strong>Eighteenth Day of Third Month 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Present:</strong> <a href="/Friends/EllenCooney">Ellen Cooney</a> (Clerk), <a href="/Friends/LindaSeegar">Linda Seger</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly Wingate</a>, <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil Friesen</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/PeterLeVar">Peter LeVar</a>, <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann Daugherty</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy Nelson</a>, <a href="/Friends/AnnGrantMartin">Ann Martin</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/SueLauther">Sue Lauther</a>, <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton Gamer</a>, <a href="/Friends/AustinHawk">Austin Hawk</a> 
and <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> (Recording Clerk).</p>
<p><strong>We began with silent worship and the reading of the following query</strong>:</p>
<p>Do you nurture your spiritual life with prayer and silent waiting and
with regular study of devotional literature?</p>
<p><strong>Approval of second month 2018 minutes</strong></p>
<p>The minutes were approved with one correction: The State of the Meeting
report is due to Yearly Meeting (not Colorado Regional) on May 1. Lisa
will make this correction.</p>
<p><em>Note: The full text of committee minutes and approved policies are
located in the Appendix following these minutes.</em></p>
<h2>COMMITTEE REPORTS</h2>
<h3>Meeting House Committee</h3>
<p>The committee asks for direction about whether an addition to the
meeting house should be pursued, and suggests that an ad-hoc committee
be established to think about this idea -- they will report to the
Meeting House Committee. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> and <a href="/Friends/LindaSeegar">Linda</a> 
are interested in joining this
committee, along with <a href="/Friends/KelseyKennedy">Kelsey</a> and a member or two from the Meeting House
Committee.</p>
<p>The <a href="#meeting-house">minutes</a> were accepted.</p>
<h3>Ministry and Oversight Committee</h3>
<p>Soup and Sharing will be May 11 at <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa</a> and <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a>'s 
house. The worship
sharing will center on the topic of racism, and discussion of the film
"I am Not Your Negro." The film is available on several online streaming
vendors, or you are invited to watch the film at the meeting house on
April 25 at 6:00 p.m. (bring snacks).</p>
<p>The <a href="#ministry-oversight">minutes</a> were accepted.</p>
<h3>Peace and Social Concerns</h3>
<p><a href="/Friends/AustinHawk">Austin</a> reported on the potluck discussion of lobbying priorities for
FCNL held at the beginning of the month. We had thirteen people present
for the discussion, and it was considered fruitful and engaging . The
following six priorities were <strong>approved</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promote policies respecting the rights and dignity of refugees,
    immigrants, and migrants living and seeking to live in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocate for universal health care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work to end gun violence through meaningful gun control legislation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursue policies that protect the environment and public lands,
    especially from commercial exploitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote policies that reduce military spending, armed interventions,
    and nuclear proliferation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote international collaboration on solving world over-population
    and sustainability problems, including women's education and
    reproductive freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional comment: All of our concerns point to ending
    institutional racism, including ending the oppression of Native
    Americans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The screening of "I Am Not Your Negro" at the meeting house on April
25 will be open to anyone interested. You are welcome to invite
people who you think would be interested. <a href="/Friends/EllenCooney">Ellen</a> will create an event
on Facebook.</p>
<p>The <a href="#peace-social-concerns">minutes</a> were accepted.</p>
<h3>Finance Committee</h3>
<p>Draft financial reports were reviewed. The financial reports are not
yet fully complete, and <a href="/Friends/KelseyKennedy">Kelsey</a> would welcome suggestions for making
them optimal. We thank <a href="/Friends/KelseyKennedy">Kelsey</a> for his work during the bookkeeper
transition, which we know has been time consuming for him.</p>
<p>There were no minutes, but the reports as submitted were accepted.</p>
<h2>OLD BUSINESS</h2>
<h3>First Day School/Safety for children in the Meeting -- Revised policy on child protection</h3>
<p>The summary one-page overview of the Child Protection Policy was
reviewed. The larger, detailed document is the official policy. The
Clerk and the Religious Education Committee will administer this
policy. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> suggested several terminology changes (youth vs.
children, removal of "assistant clerk"), which will be implemented.
It is suggested that this policy be available widely. We also think
we might need a file cabinet with a lock, or a safety deposit box to
hold sensitive documents, such as background checks. This will be
looked into.</p>
<p><strong>The policy was approved.</strong> We thank <a href="/Friends/EllenCooney">Ellen</a> for all her hard work on
preparing this document.</p>
<p>Both the one-page summary and the full policy are located in the
Appendix to these minutes.</p>
<h3>Internet /telephone</h3>
<p>The Meeting has been discussing whether we need Internet connectivity
for several months. Some Friends favor it more than others. Because it
is relatively expensive, we were not clear that the expense is justified
at this point in time. For now, the main priority is getting a phone
number for the Meeting, so that <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> can be relieved of this
responsibility, which she has assumed for many years. <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> has done
research on the cost of getting a cell phone through Consumer Cellular,
which is inexpensive at $20 per month for unlimited minutes. We can add
data in the future if needed, but want to keep it simple for now. The
phone can be rotated among members, so that the responsibility for
answering Meeting calls can be shared. The Internet access issue can be
addressed in the future should Friends feel strongly that it is needed.</p>
<p>We <strong>approved</strong> proceeding with getting a Meeting cell phone through
Consumer Cellular. <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> will set up the account.</p>
<h2>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>
<p>Pre-Meeting reminder: Please silence your cell phones. <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann D.</a> will make
small signs for both the front and back doors to remind people to
silence their cell phones before joining Meeting for Worship.</p>
<p>Anyone who follows the Meeting's Facebook page can also post on that
page. It gets a number of likes and views, so it is a good place to post
events and information about Friends.</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann D.</a> reported on a meeting she attended on the homeless situation in
Colorado Springs that included a variety of local organizations. There
are many complicated issues. Please keep in mind that the Springs Rescue
Mission now has a catering service. Supporting that service would be a
way to support the homeless population.</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> is the Feminine Hygiene supply liaison to the Springs Rescue
Mission for the homeless. Please feel free to donate appropriate items
and contact <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> for other ways to help.</p>
<p>With gratitude for our Friendly community,</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a></p>

<h2>Meeting House Committee Minutes</h2>
<h3>March 12, 2018</h3>
<p>Present: <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann Daugherty</a> (clerk), <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil Friesen</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/ClaireSheridan">Claire Sheridan</a> and <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> (recorder).</p>
<h3>Old Business</h3>
<h4>Status of drainage from basement to street</h4>
<p><a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann D.</a> has inquired with the Regional Building department, and is STILL
waiting for a response.</p>
<h4>Weather stripping windows</h4>
<p><a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> is planning to weather-strip the bottom half of the windows,
however his research indicates it may not be worth the trouble. We are
also thinking it might be helpful to caulk the top half of the windows.
The painter might be able to do this when he paints the trim.</p>
<h4>Thermostat in meeting house</h4>
<p>New simple instructions are now posted.</p>
<h3>New Business</h3>
<h4>Do we want to proceed with thinking about an addition to the Meeting House?</h4>
<p>As a committee, we are wondering if the Meeting should appoint a
committee to think about the feasibility of raising money for an
addition. As a Meeting, are we still interested in an addition (it has
been some time since we talked about it)? Do we have the money? Can we
raise the money and how? <strong>We ask the wider Meeting for guidance.</strong></p>
<p>The committee should include members from the Meeting House Committee,
the Finance Committee and anyone else with a strong interest.</p>
<h4>Loose shingles</h4>
<p>There are some loose exterior asbestos shingles on the bathroom
extension which need to be re-secured.</p>
<h3>Pending Business</h3>
<h4>Internet/phone service for the meeting house</h4>
<p>This committee was tasked with getting estimates for how much Internet
and/or phone service would cost each month. Estimates are still being
gathered. <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> will call the Ooma people to explore about remote access
voice over IP. If we can use Ooma, it will be much cheaper than going
through Comcast for phone service.</p>
<h4>Painting of meeting house trim:</h4>
<p>John Mills (a small, independent
painter), has accepted the exterior trim painting job for a sum of
$1,850. He will begin work once the weather allows. This was approved
at the December 2017 Meeting for Business. The trim color will remain
light blue, but may vary slightly from the existing color.</p>
<h4>Crawl space review/vapor barrier:</h4>
<p>At our next committee meeting on
April 10 at 1:30, we plan to pull out stuff located in the crawl space
under the wooden trap door (in the kitchen area) and review what is
there, and whether it should be retained. It is a donation from a
deceased former member of the Meeting. We will also invite <a href="/Friends/KelseyKennedy">Kelsey</a> to the
meeting, so he and <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> can assess the crawlspace vapor barrier
situation.</p>
<h4>The side garden gate needs some minor repair:</h4>
<p><a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> will fix it.</p>
<h4>Watering Peace &amp; Justice (tree) and other plantings:</h4>
<p>During this
very dry winter, we need to make sure our plantings are getting enough
water. As long as it remains so dry, we plan to water twice a month.</p>
<h3>Ongoing Reminders</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After each First Day meeting, please remove all trash and garbage
    from the building to prevent unpleasant smells. Also please empty
    the coffee pot and grounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thermostats in bathrooms: If the thermostat temperature is turned
    up, it needs to be returned to its 50 degree setting before locking
    the bathroom doors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friends, please do not donate items without checking first with the
    Meeting House Committee. Because our space is small and shared by
    all, some donations may cause discord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last person out of the building needs to double-check that all
    windows and doors are locked. Some doors have to be closed FIRMLY
    for the latches to catch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The committee now meets at 1:30 p.m. on the second Monday of the month.
We meet at the meeting house, and all are welcome.</p>
<p>We adjourned following silent worship.</p>

<h2>Ministry and Oversight Committee Minutes</h2>
<p>March 16, 2018</p>
<p>Today's meeting began with Spiritual Silence at 11:45 am at <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton
Gamer</a>'s home.</p>
<p>Present were <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton Gamer</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/AnnGrantMartin">Ann Grant Martin</a>, Clerk.</p>
<p>We reviewed the February minutes.</p>
<p>After a brief check-in we reviewed an abridged version of our Child
Protection Policy that <a href="/Friends/EllenCooney">Ellen Cooney</a> has created. It will be a shorter
rendering of a longer and more detailed Child Protection Policy
document. Members of M&amp;O agreed that this document can be named a Policy
rather than an Advice in order to avoid confusion with giving guidance.
We see merit in having both a shorter document and a more comprehensive
Child Protection Policy document</p>
<p>Regarding Worship Sharing:</p>
<p>We propose that our Meeting hold this year's Spring Soup and Sharing on
Friday, May 11, 2018 at 6:00 pm. <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil Friesen</a>'s have
graciously invited us to enjoy Soup and Sharing in their home. We feel
that it will be beneficial to continue with the theme of Racism that our
Peace and Social Concerns committee begun with their Worship Sharing
gathering on November 18, 2017. We encourage Friends to watch the movie,
"I'm Not Your Negro" prior to our Soup and Worship Sharing evening. A
possible Worship Sharing query to consider is: "How Does Structural
racism in our society relate to us as members of the Society of
Friends?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(This movie is available to Amazon Prime members)</p>
<p>Master filmmaker Raoul Peck envisions the book James Baldwin never
finished, Remember This House. The result is a radical,
up-to-the-minute examination of race in America, using Baldwin\'s
original words and flood of rich archival material. I Am Not Your
Negro is a journey into black history that connects the past of the
Civil Rights movement to the present of #BlackLivesMatter. It is a
film that questions black representation in Hollywood and beyond. And,
ultimately, by confronting the deeper connections between the lives
and assassination of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King
Jr., Baldwin and Peck have produced a work that challenges the very
definition of what America stands for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We closed with Spiritual Silence.</p>
<p>Our next meeting will be Thursday, April 12, 2018 at 1:30 at <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton
Gamer</a>'s home.</p>
<p>In the Light of Peace,</p>

<h2>Minutes of the Peace &amp; Social Concerns Committee Meeting</h2>
<h3>Feb. 28, 2018</h3>
<p>Present: <a href="/Friends/ClaireSheridan">Claire Sheridan</a>, <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly Wingate</a> 
and <a href="/Friends/AustinHawk">Austin Hawk</a>, clerk,
recording clerk pro tempore. <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann Daugherty</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/JohnRobey">John Robey</a> were unable to
attend.</p>
<h3>FCNL Priorities:</h3>
<p>On March 4th, 13 members gathered during potluck to take part in the
nationwide discernment as to what issues Friends Committee on National
Legislation should focus on for the 116th Congress (2019-2020). We were
tasked to come up with as many as 7 priorities, each being limited to 20
words or less. Below is what the group came to consensus on. The
priorities are in no particular order. FCNL is requesting that we send
our response by April 13, 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promote policies respecting the rights and dignity of refugees,
    immigrants, and migrants living and seeking to live in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocate for universal health care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work to end gun violence through meaningful gun control legislation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursue policies that protect the environment and public lands,
    especially from commercial exploitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote policies that reduce military spending, armed interventions,
    and nuclear proliferation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote international collaboration on solving world over-population
    and sustainability problems, including women's education and
    reproductive freedom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional comment: All of our concerns point to ending institutional
racism, including ending the oppression of Native Americans.</p>
<h3>Movie Screening:</h3>
<p>The Peace &amp; Social Concerns committee would like to request to host a
showing of the documentary, <em>I Am Not Your Negro</em> at the meetinghouse on
Wednesday, April 25th in the early evening. The 93-minute documentary is
entirely inspired by James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript written by
Baldwin in the mid-1970s which recounts the lives of his close friends
and civil rights leaders <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X">Malcolm
X</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Martin Luther King
Jr.</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers">Medgar
Evers</a>. One critic has
written, "[it] offers an incendiary snapshot of James Baldwin's
crucial observations on American race relations---and a sobering
reminder of how far we've yet to go." We have access to the movie and
could work toward getting access to a projector. We would potentially
need access to Wi-Fi in the meetinghouse. We would like to extend the
invitation to as many who are able to attend.</p>
<h4>AFSC &amp; FCNL</h4>
<p>This weekend, March 17-20, is FCNL's Spring Lobby Weekend. During this
event, hundreds of students, recent grads, and young adults meet in

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">Procedures for Child and Youth Abuse Prevention</h2>

<div style="text-align: center"><strong>Colorado Springs Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)<br>
Approved: 3/18/2018</strong></div>

<p>We have reviewed and approved the practices outlined in this document.
By implementing these practices, our goal is to protect the children and
youth of Colorado Springs Friends Monthly Meeting from incidents of
misconduct or inappropriate behavior while also protecting our
volunteers, employees and youth/children from false accusations.</p>
<p>This document is intended to be a working document and a reference for
those working with children and youth and will be updated when
necessary.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">I. Definitions</h3>

<p>For purposes of this document, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p>a.  "Child," "children," "minors," and "youth" are defined as
    including anyone under the age of eighteen (18).</p>
<p>b.  "Youth and child-care workers" or "workers" refers to all persons
    working with children and youth, paid and unpaid.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">II. Teachers/Child Care Providers</h3>

<p>All Child Care Provider will be screened. This screening includes a
criminal background check, to be paid for by the Meeting.</p>
<p>a.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Six-Month Rule for Volunteers</a></p>
<p>A person may be considered for any regular volunteer position involving
contact with children and youth only after s/he has been involved with
the Religious Society of Friends for a minimum of six (6) months. If the
involvement with the Colorado Springs Friends Meeting has been less than
6 months, a recommendation will be requested from the applicant's prior
meeting community.</p>
<p>b. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Personal Interview</span></p>
<p>Every prospective youth or child care worker will have a personal
interview and will be given a copy of this document. It shall be signed
by the applicant, acknowledging its receipt and their understanding of
the practices, and agreeing to the criminal background check. The
interview for prospective volunteers will be with one or more members of
the Religious Education Committee.</p>
<p>c. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reference Check</span></p>
<p>Before an applicant is permitted to work with youth and children, at
least two of the applicant's references will be checked. If the
applicant has worked with minors at another organization, the
organization(s) should be included in the two references. The Meeting
will keep the reference documentation on file.</p>
<p>d. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Personal Information</span></p>
<p>All personal information gained during the screening process about any
individual will be held in confidence by the Religious Education
Committee and any other person involved in the decision-making process.
Documents with personal information will be kept in a locked file.</p>
<p>e. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Offense</span></p>
<p>What constitutes a disqualifying offense that will keep an individual
from working with youth and children will be determined by the hiring
committee on a case-by-case basis, in light of all the surrounding
circumstances. The hiring committee will discuss with the applicant any
negative decision.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">III. Child Safety Measures</h3>

<p>a.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Staffing Goals</span></p>
<p>It is our goal that we will have at least two adults (at least 18 years
old) in attendance when youth and children are being supervised during
our programs and activities.</p>
<p>b.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Classroom Door</span></p>
<p>Classroom doors will remain unlocked while there are persons inside the
room. The Classroom door should remain open as possible, when noise from
the classroom does not disturb meeting for worship.</p>
<p>c.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bathroom Use</span></p>
<p>Youth and children age eight and older may leave the classroom to use
the bathroom on their own. Children under age 8 will be accompanied to
the bathroom by one of the adult child care providers. Parents are
encouraged to have their children use the bathroom before going to First
Day School.</p>
<p>d. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Parental Responsibility</span></p>
<p>Parents and guardians are responsible for their children during times
when children are not in First Day School or checked into child care.
Parents of children eight and under are asked not to leave children
unattended in child care or First Day School classrooms at any time.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">IV. Safety Concerns</h3>

<p>a. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Overview</span></p>
<p>We recognize that safety concerns may arise that are not allegations of
child abuse and which do not call for the response described before in
Section III. As we try to maintain an environment that is safe for our
children in every way, we hope that parents and others will feel
comfortable raising these concerns. Any person (parent or guardian,
employee, volunteer, child, or other person) with a concern regarding
safety of a child or children in the Meeting is encouraged to take the
concern to the Religious Education Committee or to the Clerk. The
Committee and the Clerk shall treat these matters with discretion and
confidentiality.</p>
<p>b. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Oversight and Implementation</span></p>
<p>The Meeting will review these best practices and implementation on an
annual basis; this shall be done by a group consisting of the Clerk or
his/her designee, one member of REC and one member of Ministry and
Oversight. The Religious Education Committee may develop procedures and
forms consistent with these best practices.</p>
<p>c. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mandatory Reporting of Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect</span></p>
<p>State and national laws covering child abuse and neglect have become far
more proactive in the protection and reporting of suspected abuse and
neglect of children. It is important for all of us who are involved in
the on-going care and education of children to be aware of the laws
regarding mandatory reporting.</p>
<p>Colorado law (C.R.S. 19-3-304) identifies several professions as
mandatory reporters of suspected child abuse and neglect. Two of these
categories are public or private school officials or employees and
members of the Clergy and leaders of religious communities. It is a
class 3 misdemeanor in Colorado for a mandated reporter to fail to
report suspected child abuse or neglect or knowingly make a false report
and is punishable under law.</p>
<p>For purposes of these best practices, Colorado Springs Friends Meeting
has identified the Clerk and all youth and child-care workers (both
employees and volunteers) as mandatory reporters.</p>
<p>d. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Training</span></p>
<p>All mandatory reporters shall successfully complete the online Mandated
Reporter Training For Colorado Educators which can be found at
<a href="https://www.coloradocwts.com/mandated-reporter-training">https://www.coloradocwts.com/mandated-reporter-training</a> [
]{.underline} prior to providing youth and child-care services at the
Colorado Springs Friends Meeting. A certificate of completion (issued at
the end of the online training and successfully passing the quizzes) for
each mandatory reporter shall be maintained by the convener for the
Religious Education Committee.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">V. Mandatory Reporting</h3>

<p>a.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reporting</span></p>
<p>If a mandatory reporter has reasonable cause to know or suspect that a
child/ youth has been subjected to abuse or neglect or observed the
child being subjected to circumstances or conditions that would
reasonably result in abuse or neglect, the mandatory reporter shall,
immediately upon receiving such information, report or cause a report to
be made of such fact (1) through the child abuse reporting hotline
system. (Call 1-844-CO-4-Kids or 1-844-264-5437), or (2) to the Colorado
Springs County Department of Human Services or (3) to the Colorado
Springs Police Department.</p>
<p>b.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Guidance and Support for Reporting Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect within the Colorado Springs Meeting of Friends</span></p>
<p>In addition to the mandatory reporting requirements, any First Day
School teacher, child care provider, or member or attender at Colorado
Springs Meeting of Friends who witnesses or suspects abuse and/or
neglect of a child under the care and supervision of the Meeting should
immediately inform the Clerk of Colorado Springs Meeting; in the event
that the Clerk is not available, it shall be reported to the convener of
Ministry and Oversight. It shall be the duty of the Clerk, along with
the Meeting's Ministry and Oversight Committee, to offer guidance,
support and council to everyone affected, and, if and when it is deemed
appropriate, to the Meeting community.</p>
<p>The protection and well-being of the child or children involved is of
paramount concern. In the event of such suspected abuse, the Colorado
Springs Friend's Meeting will proceed with the greatest of care and
discernment, providing confidentiality for all involved, to the extent
possible.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">VI. If A Youth or Child Discloses Abuse</h3>

<p>If you're in a situation where a youth or child discloses abuse to you,
there are a number of steps you can take. </p>
<p>a. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Listen carefully to the youth or child</span></p>
<p>Avoid expressing your own views on the matter. A reaction of shock or
disbelief could cause the youth or child to 'shut down', retract or
stop talking. You should not question the youth or child or press for
details, and other adults should not question the youth or child. That
should be saved for the forensic interview.</p>
<p>b. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Let them know they've done the right thing</span></p>
<p>Reassurance can make a big impact to the youth or child who may have
been keeping the abuse secret</p>
<p>c. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tell them it\'s not their fault</span></p>
<p>Abuse is never the youth or child's fault and they need to know this</p>
<p>d. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Say you believe them</span></p>
<p>A youth or child could keep abuse secret in fear they won't be
believed. They've told you because they want help and trust you'll be
the person to believe them and help them. The reporter does not need to
be sure that abuse occurred or get details to prove that abuse occurred.
That is the job of professionals who can elicit that information in ways
that would allow successful prosecution of the abuser, if abuse
occurred.</p>
<p>e. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Don't talk to the alleged abuser</span></p>
<p>Confronting the alleged abuser about what the youth or child has told
you could make the situation a lot worse for the youth or child</p>
<p>f. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Explain what you'll do next</span></p>
<p>If age appropriate, explain to the youth or child you'll need to report
the abuse to someone who will be able to help</p>
<p>g. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Don't delay reporting the abuse</span></p>
<p>The sooner the abuse is reported after the youth or child discloses the
better. Report as soon as possible so details are fresh in your mind and
action can be taken quickly.</p>
<p>h. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Clerk's Responsibilities after Notification</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the adult who witnessed the abuse or heard a disclosure
    of abuse from a youth or child has made a report to the appropriate
    authorities for further investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact those authorities to determine if or when it is appropriate
    to discuss the allegation with parents, the alleged abuser, and
    others in the Meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When authorities indicate that such communication is appropriate the
    Clerk shall:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the parent and/or guardian of the youth or child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the Conveners of the Religious Education and Oversight and
    Membership Committees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the worker/volunteer alleged to be the perpetrator and
    immediately place him or her on leave from working with children
    pending an investigation. During the investigation, an alleged
    perpetrator will not be permitted to participate in any Meeting
    activities involving youth and/or children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the Meeting's insurance company, complete an accident report,
    and forward any documents related to the incident and/or
    allegations to the insurance company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the name of the youth or child shall not be entered into
    the minutes of any meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remind Friends of the potential harm to both youth/children and
    adults that can come from gossip or idle discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep all information confidential outside of those who need to know
    information in order to carry out these practices; the
    confidentiality requirement includes all this who become aware of
    the incident.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">VII. Effective Date/Changes to Best Practice</h3>

<p>The Clerk and the Committee on Religious Education shall be responsible
for the enforcement and maintenance of these best practices. Any
proposed changes to these best practices shall be proposed to the
Meeting for Business for final approval. Keep all information
confidential outside of those who need to know information in order to
carry out these practices; the confidentiality requirement includes all
this who become aware of the incident.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">VIII. The Meeting's Responsibilities</h3>

<p>No adult will question the youth or child or discuss the incident with
the child on behalf of the Meeting, as this could influence the legal
process. The adult should not question the youth or child or press for
details, and other adults should not question the youth or child. That
should be saved for the forensic interview.</p>
<p>The person reporting does not need to be sure that abuse occurred or get
details to prove that abuse occurred. That is the job of professionals
who can elicit that information in ways that would allow successful
prosecution of the abuser, if abuse occurred.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">IX. Effective Date/Changes to Best Practices</h3>

<p>These best practices will become effective immediately after being
approved.</p>
<p>The Clerk and the Committee on Religious Education shall be responsible
for the enforcement and maintenance of these best practices. Any
proposed changes to the protocol shall be proposed to the Meeting for
Business for final approval.</p>
