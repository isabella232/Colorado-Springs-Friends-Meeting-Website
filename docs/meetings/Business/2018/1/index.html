   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   <h1>MINUTES</h1>
<h1>Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business</h1>
<h2>Colorado Springs Friends Meeting</h2>
<h2>Twenty-First Day of First Month 2018</h2>
<p><strong>Present</strong>: <a href="/Friends/AnnGrantMartin">Ann-Grant Martin</a> (acting clerk), <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton Gamer</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/KateHolbrook">Kate Holbrook</a>, <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> (recording clerk).</p>
<p>Ann read the following advice and queries from Intermountain Yearly
Meeting Faith and Practice:</p>
<p>Each of us has a particular experience of God, and each must find the
way to be true to it. When another's words are strange or disturbing to
you, seek to understand where they come from. Listen patiently and seek
the truth that other people's thoughts may contain for you. Avoid
hurtful criticism and provocative language. Be careful not to be too
firm in your position; allow for the possibility that you may be
mistaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do we trust sufficiently the goodwill of our meeting members and
    attenders to make our needs and concerns known?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we care for one another so deeply that each other's needs are
    recognized and addressed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are we charitable with each other, being careful not to sully the
    reputations of others?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Approval of Twelfth Month 2017 minutes</h3>
<p>The minutes were approved, with a typo change.</p>
<h2>COMMITTEE REPORTS</h2>
<h3>Meeting House Committee</h3>
<p>Painting of the trim will happen when the weather allows. The
committee plans to clean out and arrange our storage room at the
next tidy-up day if it is not too cold that day. Minutes accepted.</p>
<h3>Ministry and Oversight Committee</h3>
<p>Minutes accepted.</p>
<p>The Meeting wishes to thank <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy</a> for his years of service as a
member of M &amp; O, and to welcome <a href="/Friends/PeterLeVar">Peter LeVar</a>, who is now part of the
committee.</p>
<p>The Committee wants to share an Advice which was <strong>approved</strong> at
today's Meeting for Business. They ask Friends to consider this
Advice carefully:</p>
<p><strong>Ministry &amp; Oversight Committee wishes to express our commitment to
protecting the privacy of the Members and Attenders of our Meeting. We
regard this as an absolute principle of conduct. Private information
about a Friend's past is not appropriate content for conversations
and/or emails.</strong></p>
<h3>Finance Committee</h3>
<p>The Meeting's new bookkeeper is Beatrix Clegg.</p>
<p>The final budget for 2018 was <strong>approved,</strong> with the addition of adding
the expense of procuring a 501(c)3 status.</p>
<p>The verbal finance committee report was accepted.</p>
<p>The cash flow report, savings update report and all year-end financial
statements were accepted.</p>
<p>The following Minute of Appreciation for <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a> was
<strong>approved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Meeting is grateful for the exemplary and steadfast service of
<a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a> as our Treasurer and Bookkeeper for the past 14 years.
Her careful documentation of the fiscal health of the meeting has been
indispensable in allowing us to qualify for a mortgage and ongoing
grants on behalf of the meeting. She has provided the Meeting with an
ongoing, clear and accurate picture of the state of our finances,
allowing us to be better stewards of our resources. We thank her from
the bottom of our hearts for sharing her skills, time and caring for so
many years.</strong></p>
<h3>First Day School</h3>
<p>Our older young Friends got together for games on New Year's Eve and a
good time was had by all!</p>
<p>A draft policy for child protection at the Meeting (based on the yearly
meeting's policy), is close to a final version, and will presented at a
future business meeting.</p>
<h3>Nominating Committee</h3>
<p>Service positions for 2018 were <strong>approved (</strong>See appendix).</p>
<p>The Nominating Committee wishes to thank everyone who has agreed to
serve the Meeting this coming year. All positions are filled except for
the need to have an additional member on the Finance Committee.</p>
<h2>NEW BUSINESS</h2>
<p>The Meeting House Committee will explore how much it would cost to get
wifi in the meeting house, and report back at the next business meeting.
This is an exploration to determine feasibility.</p>
<h2>OTHER BUSINESS</h2>
<p>We hosted a Centering Prayer workshop on January 21 at the meeting
house. Fifteen participants attended the workshop, five from the
Meeting, and the rest from the broader Colorado Springs community. Four
presenters from Benet Hill led us through the essentials of centering
prayer. After <a href="/Friends/EllenCooney">Ellen</a>'s accident, members pulled together and coordinated
the tasks necessary to host this event, and all went splendidly.</p>
<p>We closed in silence.</p>
<p>In the Light,</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a>, recording clerk</p>
<p><em>Note: The full text of committee minutes are located in the appendices
following these minutes.</em></p>
<h2>APPENDICES</h2>
<h2>Meeting House Committee Minutes</h2>
<p><strong>January 8, 2018</strong></p>
<p>Present: <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann Daugherty</a> (clerk), <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil Friesen</a> 
and <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> (recorder).
<a href="/Friends/ClaireSheridan">Claire Sheridan</a> was unable to attend.</p>
<p><strong><em>Old Business</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Painting of meeting house trim</strong></p>
<p><a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> contacted John Mills (a small, independent painter), and he
accepted the exterior trim painting job for a sum of $1,850. He will
begin work once the weather allows. This was approved at the December
2017 Meeting for Business. The trim color will remain light blue, but
may vary slightly.</p>
<p><strong>Weather stripping windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> is willing to weather-strip the bottom half of the windows. He is
figuring out how much the materials will cost.</p>
<p><strong>Status of drainage from basement to street</strong></p>
<p><a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann D.</a> has inquired with the Regional Building department, and is STILL
waiting for a response.</p>
<p><strong>Crawl Space review postponed until Spring:</strong> We still plan to pull
out stuff located in the crawl space under the wooden trap door (in the
kitchen area) and review what is there, and whether it should be
retained. It is a donation from a deceased former member of the Meeting.
Anyone who is interested should feel free to join us for this review.</p>
<p><strong>Storage room:</strong> The storage room (by the bathrooms) needs to be
cleaned out and better organized. We plan to do this on the next
clean-up Sunday if it is warm.</p>
<p><strong><em>New Business</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The side garden gate needs some minor repair:</strong> <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> will fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Crawl space vapor barrier (still pending)</strong>: We want to look at the
crawl space area to see if we should add black plastic vapor barrier
over the dirt, which might improve those occasional mystery smells.
<a href="/Friends/KelseyKennedy">Kelsey Kennedy</a> and <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> are willing to evaluate the situation and
perhaps do the work.</p>
<p><strong>Watering Peace &amp; Justice (tree) and other plantings:</strong> During this
very dry winter, we need to make sure our plantings are getting enough
water. As long as it remains so dry, we plan to water twice a month.</p>
<p><strong>Bathroom thermostat</strong></p>
<p>We decided to write up instructions on the proper setting of the
thermostats and how they work.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ongoing Reminders</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After each First Day meeting, please remove all trash and garbage
    from the building to prevent unpleasant smells. Also please empty
    the coffee pot and grounds.</li>
<li>Thermostats in bathrooms: If the temperature is turned up, they need
    to be returned to their 50 degree setting before locking the
    bathroom doors.</li>
<li>
<p>Friends, please do not donate items without checking first with the
    Meeting House Committee. Because our space is small and shared by
    all, some donations may cause discord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last person out of the building needs to double-check that all
    windows and doors are locked. Some doors have to be closed FIRMLY
    for the latches to catch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>New Meeting Time for Committee</em></strong></p>
<p>The committee now meets at 1:30 p.m. on the second Monday of the month.
We meet at the meeting house, and all are welcome.</p>
<p>We adjourned following silent worship.</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a></p>
<p>Recording Clerk</p>
<h2>Ministry and Oversight Committee Minutes: January 15, 2018</h2>
<p>Present: <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton Gamer</a>, <a href="/Friends/PeterLeVar">Peter LeVar</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/AnnGrantMartin">Ann Martin</a> clerk.</p>
<p>We opened with Spiritual Silence at 11:30 and a brief check-in.</p>
<p>We reviewed the December minutes.</p>
<p>Members of the M&amp;O wish to express our gratitude to <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy Nelson</a> for
his wisdom and Quaker guidance during his two years of serving on the
Ministry and Oversight Committee.</p>
<p>We went over the preparations that have been made for the Centering
Prayer Workshop that will be next Saturday, January 20, 2018. All is in
order with thanks to those who will make the necessary preparations. We
are grateful to <a href="/Friends/EllenCooney">Ellen Cooney</a>, our Clerk who has made most of the
arrangements for this event.</p>
<p>We examined the latest draft of the Child Protection Policies that the
Religious Education Committee has given us. It is detailed and complete.
The only item we wish to highlight is the signature requirement at the
end. Typically Quakers don't sign a Quaker agreement because our word is
our bond. However, we do recognize that for legal purposes, a signature
is required. We are appreciative of the Religious Education Committee's
diligent work that has resulted in a well conceived document that
ensures that our children will be safe in First Day School.</p>
<p>Members of the M&amp;O Committee wish to express our commitment to
protecting the privacy of the Members and Attenders of our Meeting. We
regard this as an absolute principle of conduct. Private information
about a Friend's past is not appropriate content for conversations
and/or emails. We feel that the approval of this advice by the Meeting
is important.</p>
<p>Our next Meeting will be Monday, Feb. 12, 2018 at 11:00 at the home of
<a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton Gamer</a>.</p>
