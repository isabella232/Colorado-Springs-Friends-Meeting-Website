   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<h2>APPENDICES:</h2>
<p>Ministry and Oversight Committee Minutes, April 5, 2016</p>
<p>Present were [Carlton Gamer][CarltonGamer], [Jeremy Nelson][JeremyNelson] 
and <a href="/Friends/AnnGrantMartin">Ann Grant Martin</a>, Clerk</p>
<p>We met at [Carlton's][CarltonGamer] home and began with Spiritual Silence 
at 11:00. We had check-in and then reviewed the March minutes.</p>
<p>We have the intention of creating a document that describes the function of each of our 
Meeting's committees. We will work to complete that project.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing several Friendly Quaker calls we learned about various members’ concerns and 
requests. We heard that it would be good for our Meeting to choose one service project that 
most of us could support and participate in. It was suggested that we combine the 
Representatives/Committees of Peace and Justice, FCNL, and AFSC into one committee with one 
Clerk in order to be more effective. Another member would like more references to Bible 
scripture in our vocal ministries. There was a request for guidance in business practices and 
development. Please see a member of the M&amp;O Committee to find out who you can help.</p>
<p>We will continue reviewing our Friendly Quaker calls at our next meeting, May 17th.</p>
<p>We closed at 12:05 with a period of Silence.</p>
<p>In the Light,                     </p>

<h3>Finance Committee Meeting</h3>
<h4>Fourth Month, 5th day, 2016</h4>
<p>Present: <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a> (Bookkeeper, Treasurer, &amp; Clerk) 
and <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> (Recorder) and <a href="/Friends/JohnRobey">John Robey</a> 
were in attendance. </p>
<p>The meeting was held at the meetinghouse.</p>
<p>We opened with silence.</p>
<p>We carefully reviewed all financial reports for the period ending 
3-31-2016 and found all to be in good order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cash Flow Report </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank Balance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ent Savings Detail Update</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current Month Planning of Available Funds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our year-round "budget billing" utility payment will reduce this coming year 
to $141 a month (down from $144).</p>
<p>Approval requested:</p>
<p>Travel funds are depleted for this budget year, and we are not currently in a position to 
reserve funds for the future.  Because we feel it is important to help Friends with their 
travel requests when needed to attend yearly meeting, representative meeting, and 
regional meeting, we would like to suggest that proceeds from our upcoming yard/garage 
sale (to be organized by Holly) go into our Travel Fund account.  Would Friends approve 
this suggestion?</p>
<p>We also discussed the FGC Friends Meeting House loan application, which <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> 
is almost finished with.  <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa</a> will sign it and submit it to Friends 
General Conference this month.</p>
<p>We closed in silence.</p>
