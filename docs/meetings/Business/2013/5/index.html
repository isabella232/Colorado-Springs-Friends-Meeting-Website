   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>Silence followed by a reading for the Boulder Meetings Friends's 
    Newsletter, <em>Miscellany</em>. 
    From Howard Brinton quote,</p>
<p>For Friends the most important consideration is not the right action in itself, but a right inward
state out of which right action will arise. Given the right inward state, right action is inevitable.
Inward state and outward action are component parts of a single whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consideration of April Minutes, approved</p>
</li>

<p>Clerk's Report: Friends, we continue to have a cash flow problem. We have an 
    average monthly need of $1,170 and an average monthly income of $888, which 
    is up $185 from last month. In reserve, we have 6 months of expenses related 
    to the building, and less than 1 month of expenses related to the work of the 
    meeting. Our goal is to keep 6 months reserve on hand at all times. We also 
    have about $3,605 that is designated specifically for building projects and 
    nearly $500 designated for emergencies as determined by Ministry and Oversight. 
    The upshot is that we have money in the bank, but we are depleting our reserves. 
    Many thanks to Finance Committee for keeping us fiscally aware.</p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone for making the Colorado Regional Meeting Spring Gathering 
a success. Thanks especially to those who cleaned before and after the event, 
brought tables and tablecloths,  and brought extra food.  Our guests were very 
happy to enjoy our new home.</p>
