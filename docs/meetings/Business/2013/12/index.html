   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>Clerk's Report:  The meeting seems to be in good shape in terms of 
    the physical building, our finances, and people doing service on its

    on the spiritual and worship aspects of my faith and to be of service to 
    the meeting and the wider Quaker committee.  It has been an honor and a 
    pleasure to be clerk.  I wish to thank <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy Nelson</a>, 
    recording clerk, and everyone else who is stepping down from one position
