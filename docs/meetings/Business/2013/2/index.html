   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   (see attached cash flow report). Bank balance is now $795.00. Transfers made from savings
   and checking reserves.  Total savings $6,8868.48 and Total building funds is $8,440.25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Committee Reports:</p>
<p>a. Finance Committee - <a href="/Friends/SarahCallback">Sarah</a> read the Finance Committee Minutes, Finance committee begs that
   that Friends consider their usage of the utilities. Some parts we do have control and 
   every effort made to control the costs.</p>
<p>Sarah went over the "A Very Basic Cash Flow" revised the Shorten the cash flows. Sarah 
   explained some of the revision from the original. We come up about $50.00 a month short
   on average and it being back-filled with reserves but is not sustain. Reserve will only
   last for the next couple of months at the current. Consider cash flows very carefully
   on the implications to fund the various assessments and suggest donations, fund 
   programs and other organizations, including scholarships to IMYM, websites, and other
   expenses. </p>
<p>Molly doesn't think it so bad that we are only $50.00 a month short, conscious of the 
   shortfall but to function up to $50.00, Sarah said we need more to continue. Estimated
   than less than 10%. Naomi asked about the costs sent to external organizations, 
   IMYM is . Bill part of the value to our overall Quaker experiences. Question about 
   what suggestions for improving the budget by increasing revenue.   </p>
<p>The Finance report was accepted.  </p>
<p>i. Ad hoc Fund Raising Committee. With Sarah's help Moll will be mailing a letter
      out to past donors to the Meeting.</p>
<p>b. Nominating Committee </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a> and <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill</a>, included Steward Position and 
   guidelines, includes a master of 
   copy of the calendar including the renting or providing space for prospective 
   users of the space and that the organization follows Quaker's values. Steward 
   would rent space. People have already asked about renting space. If this 
   position was accepted the steward would coordinate. Need to find someone to 
   do and writing down the description. Meeting Steward, Peter La Var was the 
   calendar keeper, a Steward has a broader responsibilities and oversee groups
   to use the building. Meeting House Committee already takes up many of the 
   duties of a Steward Position. Calendar keeper would have some Steward 
   Positions and know that the Meeting Committee. </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton</a> asked if this position needed to live near? Molly responded not 
   necessarily. Naomi asked about breaking up the position to just monthly. It 
   will happen.</p>
<p>Any ideas about how much to rent for? Molly suggested not more than $20.00 
   an hour. Suggested donations from non-profits, many 12-steps programs meet 
   once-a-month. Meeting Home Committee and Finance Committee meet with new
   Calendaring position. </p>
<p>Lisa asked if the Calendaring position would need to attend the outside 
   group event? No, especially if a group is regular user of space. </p>
<p>c. Ministry and Oversight </p>
<p>Molly was happy to notice about an evening Meeting for Worship once a 
   month. Molly wants to encourage meeting to continue forward. Worship 
   sharing about the doing this Wednesday, March 20th. Different than 
   a Meeting for Worship focused around a couple of different topics, 
   Peace Testimony or personal stewardship of natural resources. Friends agreed
   that a worship sharing on March 20th. Some prefers on the topic? Stewardship
   in our daily lives was suggested to M&amp;O.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for a monthly evening Meeting for Worship. Asked 6-7pm or 7-8pm? 
   Asked question of member and attender phone calls preferences for an evening
   Meeting for Worship.  </p>
<p>M&amp;O report acceptance.  </p>

   electrical work and insulation for roof was $1,100? Was in total from two months 
   ago. Meeting Home committee won't do anything </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/DanielKidney">Daniel</a> estimated fixing the side fence replacing with a new gate. When we can 
   get we will.</p>
<p>Donated chairs should be cleaned and the metal tubing fixed. Investigate pull down 
   windows upper sash to improve air circulation when the weather warms up. </p>
<p>Discussed buying a couple of wood screens block back door both $100 to get two of 
   them? What about just getting two screens, sometimes balance is mathematical we might

<p>Carlton mentioned that keeping the furnace off during Meeting for Worship and thanks
   the Meeting Home committee. Explained that she sets the heat to rise up to 70 degrees
   and then sets the temperature to 65 and so the furnace didn't come on. </p>
