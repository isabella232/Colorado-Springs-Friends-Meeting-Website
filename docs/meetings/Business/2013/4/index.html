   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>Clerk's report:</p>
<p>Friends, we have a cash flow problem. We have an average monthly need of 
  $1170 and an average monthly income of $703. In reserve, we have 6 months 
  of expenses related to the building, and just about 4 months of expenses 
  related to the work of the meeting. Our goal is to keep 6 months reserve 
  on hand at all times. We also have about $500 that is designated 
  specifically for building projects and $500 designated for emergencies as 
  determined by Ministry and Oversight. The upshot is that we have money in 
  the bank, but we are depleting our reserves. Many thanks to Finance 
  Committee for keeping us fiscally aware.</p>
<p>Upon <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a>'s request, <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> created a graph 
  to illustrate the current cash flow reports and passed it around to Friends
  at the meeting. <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill</a> asked about the ratio of reserves? 
  <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> talked about
  having a six months reserves. Recording Clerk will include the graph in the 
  minutes and send the graph.  </p>
