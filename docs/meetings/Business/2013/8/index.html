   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   <p>MINUTES for MEETING for WORSHIP with a CONCERN for BUSINESS
Colorado Springs Quaker Meeting
Meeting began August 18, at 11:50 am</p>
<p>Present: <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly Wingate</a>, <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie Durland</a>, <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann Daugherty</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton Gamer</a>, <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/BarbaraBowen">Barbara Bowen</a>, <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a> 
and visitor Theresa Rosenthal.  </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> offered a reading by Elise Boulding followed by silence.</p>
<pre><code>    For the real difference between happiness and joy is that one is 
    grounded in this world, the other in eternity. Happiness cannot 
encompass suffering and evil. Joy can. Happiness depends on the
    present. Joy leaps into the future and triumphantly creates a new present
out of it.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Minutes of the Meeting for Worship for Business of June 23 were approved 
    with recomendations to <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy</a> on finances sent by 
    <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finances: <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> first reviewed the cash flow report, which 
    indicates overall improvement in our finances. It was noted that we have 
    moved within close range of our projected 6-months mortgage reserve and 
    6-months general reserve. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> noted that there was a 
    small increase in our utility bill due to water surcharge due to draught. 
    There were no questions and Friends approved the cash flow report.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee Report followed. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> noted that 
<a href="/Friends/BillWerling">Bill Werling's</a> donation to Vicki Aldrich's war tax issue was 
not needed, nor does he want it returned. It was decided to keep it in our 
Emergency fund. Friends Fiduciary has sent out an E-bulletin detailing their 
socially responsible investing. <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a> agreed to write 
a thank-you to them. It was decided to, once again, forego disbursements at 
<a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah's</a> recommendation in hopes of fully recovering our 
financial health by next Quarter. Friends approved and Molly urged the 
importance of not doing this again since this is the second time in a row. </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> then briefly reviewed the balance sheet and revenue 
statement. There were no questions. Friends are urged to read all financial 
reports carefully, whether attending business meeting or not so that we are 
all aware of our financial position.</p>
<p>Friends approved all finance reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ministry and Oversight Report</em>: Anne submitted the M&amp;O report in writing. 
    Highlights were notations on contact with Sherry Macmahon, 
    <a href="/Friends/KathyIde">Kathy Ide</a> and [Jonathan McPhee][[Jonathan McPhee]. It was noted 
    that [Martha Lutz's][<a href="/Friends/MarthaLutz">MarthaLutz</a> service relationship with 
    <a href="/Friends/PamHazelton">Pam Hazelton</a> has come to an end. <a href="/Friends/MarthaLutz">Martha</a> noted 
    she has gained in positive ways from that relationship. M&amp;O is 
    reconsidering the question of phone calls to members and attenders. It was
    noted that the important thing is some kind of regular contact involving 
    careful listening. Phone calls are one way, personal visits, etc. can also 
    serve the purpose. M&amp;O will continue their consideration of this question. 
    M&amp;O report was accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Meeting Home Committee</em>: <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> thanked Teresa for mowing 
    our weeds and Teresa shared her involvement in the neighborhood "garden 
    club," including a block meeting to take place next Saturday, and her hope 
    that we might find ways to participate. We offered her the Meetinghouse for 
    their meetings if needed. <a href="/Friends/BarbaraBowen">Barbara</a> reported on her efforts 
    to find donated plants. So far she has received a $25.00 coupon from Home 
    Depot. <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa</a> wants to donate two lilac bushes,
    <a href="/Friends/BarbaraBowen">Barbara</a> will donate lavender and <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a>, 
    iris.</p>
<p>It was decided to include landscaping projects among the jobs every workday 
until winter. <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Anne D.</a> agreed to make an overall plan with 
<a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa's</a> help.</p>
<p>During the discussion the subject of having dealings with the Boy Scouts 
and Home Depot led to a wider discussion of how Quakers live in the world 
dealing with organizations and businesses that have practices contrary to 
our Testimonies. <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> suggested a wider discussion with 
the entire Meeting sometime in the next quarter. She will organize it. 
<a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a> noted that we still have $800 in our fund for meeting 
home projects, some of which might be used on the landscaping.</p>
<p>Meeting Home Report was accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Adult Education and Action</em>: There being no one coming forward to 
    coordinate adult education, <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a> agrees to do it 
    again this year. His proposal for the coming year is to study modern Quaker
    faith and practice. <a href="/Friends/JaneMilburn">Jane Milburn</a> suggested several weeks ago 
    that she would appreciate evening meetings, <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Anne Daughterty</a> 
    strongly approves as well since she usually has to work on Sundays. It was 
    decided that we will check with those who usually attend and choose an evening 
    once a month to have adult education at the Meetinghouse.</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> reported that the book-reading group has finished The 
Last Runaway and will start something else soon. She asked for a check of 
available library funds so that Meeting can purchase Maxine 
Kaufman-Lucosta's book, <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland's</a> newest book on economic 
ethics, and Kathy Hyzey's book on Quaker leadership.</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> also suggested the formation of a Speakers' Bureau 
asking <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill</a> to make a presentation about his book. Adult Education 
Report was accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nominating Committee</em>: <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a> reported that 
    [Nancy Andrew][NancyAndrew], not <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a>, is the new 
    librarian. </p>
<p><a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a> has agreed to be Representative Committee 
Representative. A discussion of the difficulty of filing positions in 
meetings followed with special attention to the fact that both 
<a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> (Clerk) and <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy</a> (Recording Clerk) 
reach the end of their terms in January. Several good ideas arose including 
outgoing officers taking a role in helping to find and prepare their 
successors and posting a list of positions to be filed, making frequent 
announcements in meeting to draw attention to the meeting's needs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Meeting for Worship for Business ended with a period of worship.</p>
<p>In the Light,</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie Durland</a></p>
<p>Substituting for <a href="/Friends/JeremyNelson">Jeremy Nelson</a></p>
