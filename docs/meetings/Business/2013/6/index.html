   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>A.  Finance Committee: Cash Flow Report and other financial reports
    Review of Minutes from Committee Meeting. Friends are encouraged 
    to read the Cash Flow report for specifics on the May. May started
    with a lot of cash but the Meeting paid for travel of Quetzal and 
    Caliope.</p>
<pre><code>[Sarah][SarahCallbeck] Likes to start with at least 600.00 a month to cover basic 
Meeting expenses. We started May with $5,000 in the building fund but after
insulation and fans the net cash left over the Building is around 800.00 
in the Building Fund. [Molly][MollyWingate] asked if we have a six month
reserve, [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] said we did but barely. [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] 
showed the decreasing utilities bill due to less gas for the furnace.

Good news that we did receive are exemption to local taxes from El 
Paso County as a religious.

The cash flow was accepted. Finance Committee didn't meet, will meet 
next month. [Molly][MollyWingate] asked if we could drop our Dex as most inquires are
coming from individuals finding information about the Meeting are 
from online. [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] mentioned that the next opportunity will be at the
beginning

<p>B.  Meetinghouse Committee:  Review of Minutes from Committee Meeting
    Insulation completed electricity and the fans implements. Use of the building
    by other groups is recommend by the Meeting house committee, the suggest 
    donation for use by these other groups so to avoid
    any problems with sales tax.</p>
<pre><code>House cleaning will be on June 30th.
