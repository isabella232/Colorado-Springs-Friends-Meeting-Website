   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>Meeting opened with silence at 11:23 followed by the following reading
from Britain Yearly Meeting's Advices and Queries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Be aware of the spirit of God at work in the ordinary activities and
experience of your daily life. Spiritual learning continues throughout
life, and often in unexpected ways. There is inspiration to be found
all around us, in the natural world, in the sciences and arts, in our
work and friendships, in our sorrows as well as in our joys. Are you
open to new light, from whatever source it may come?</em></p>

    reference to the individual that was arrested for stealing the
    blank checks from the front porch of the meeting. <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a>
    proposed the following: <strong>For the sake of restorative justice
    and our own Quaker values, we believe that a personal
    relationship between the defendant and our community is helpful.
    We would ask the court to rely on restitution and community
    service as alternatives to a jail sentence.</strong> It was noted that
    we did not know much information on where this case was in the
    judicial process. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallback">Sarah</a> indicated that she would research the
