   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

   <h1>Minutes for Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business</h1>
<h2>Colorado Springs Friends Meeting</h2>
<p>Eighteenth day of the first month, 2015</p>
<p>In Attendance: <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a>, <a href="/Friends/BillWerling">Bill Werling</a>, <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/JonathanMcPhee">Jonathan McPhee</a>, <a href="/Friends/JohnRobey">John Robey</a>, <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a> , and <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie Durland</a> </p>
<p>Meeting opened with silence at 11:35 followed by the following reading from Faith and Practice: </p>
<p><em>For it is the corporate Truth or Light for which Friends labor together, not 
the proof or justification of the rightness of any particular position</em> (Barney Aldrich, p. 119).  </p>
<p><em>I always go to the monthly meetings because if I don't, they usually end up 
doing some darn thing or other.</em> (Nancy Springer, p. 119).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Acceptance of minutes:
    Twelfth month: not approved due to oversight, to be addressed next month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ministry and Oversight Committee</strong>: did not meet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meeting House Committee</strong>: Minutes accepted. <strong>Summary</strong>: Refinancing 
    our mortgage will be an ongoing discussion for some time.  We will need 
    to refinance before we have a "balloon" payment in 2016 or 2017.  [Ann] 
    will get us the dates and numbers we need to start having serious 
    conversations with FGC and other lenders.  We also discussed the idea 
    of borrowing money in addition to what is owed on the mortgage so that 
    we could build an addition to include bathrooms, a kitchen and storage. 
    We have many considerations.  Please send your thoughts to [Ann][AnnDaughtery] 
    or bring them to the committee.  The committee meets at 9AM at the meeting 
    house on the second Sunday. At the committee meeting there was also discussion 
    about grants for larger projects at the meeting house.  The FGC Meeting House 
    Fund has grants for greening the meetinghouse and we received one to replace 
    the heater.  A possible future grant request would be to replace the doors 
    of the meeting house so that they are easier to operate and more weather proof 
    and redo the foyer.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>First Day School</strong> - no report</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finance Committee</strong>: the minutes and financial reports were accepted with 
    many thanks. <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a> reviewed year-end financial statements. 
    At their monthly meeting, the Finance Committee discussed the calculation of funds 
    available for budget needs.  Currently, the Meeting has $1,400 from year-end donations 
    available for budget allocation.  A decision was made to allocate thoughtfully, since 
    some pledge monies, now at $910 per month, are likely to be received as annual rather 
    than monthly contributions.  Given this consideration, it was proposed that the budget 
    for 2015 should remain in its reduced form (as presented at the December 2014 business meeting), 
    and the $1,400 allocated conservatively.  For travel to IMYM, $415 would be allocated 
    to Travel Reserve.  Another $50 would be placed in Emergency Reserve.  Any balance 
    not needed for January expenses would be put into the Mortgage Reserve.  The Finance 
    Committee requested approval of this decision. The business meeting approved this request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Library</strong>: No report</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nominating Committee</strong>: Nominating committee did not report, however, there is a 
    dire need of another person to be on the Finance Committee (contact <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> 
    if interested - molly@wingate-consulting.com ). Also, <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a> will 
    be leaving the M&amp;O Committee (as he was on the committee in an interim basis only). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peace and Justice Committee</strong>: There was discussion on how the Meeting should 
    respond to the NAACP bombing.  The possible options discussed were meeting to 
    discuss this issue (and related issues), officially expressing our willingness to 
    provide support as needed or standby and await any request for assistance from 
    the NAACP as <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill Durland</a> has already contacted them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Old Business - items listed in the announcements were discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Business - none discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Announcements</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>February potluck will be February 1.  <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a> will facilitate a discussion
    on the queries related to the IMYM Minute on the Rights of Indigenous
    Peoples.  This is an important topic, and we hope that we can have good
    sharing on this topic.  <a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa</a> will send the queries out in advance of
    potluck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formation of adult education book study and discussion group.  We are
proposing that we start with The Essential Elias Hicks.  <a href="/Friends/BillDurland">Bill</a> and <a href="/Friends/GenieDurland">Genie</a>
will facilitate the discussion.  After an informal poll was taken about
best times to meet, it was determined that after meeting on the 2nd Sunday
of each month works for most.   The first meeting, therefore, will be
March 8.  The book is available for $13.50 from Amazon, or $15 from the FGC
bookstore.   Please RSVP to durlandwe@gmail.com if you will be attending.</p>
