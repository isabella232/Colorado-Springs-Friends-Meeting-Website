   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<p>Meeting opened with silence at 11:21 followed by the following reading
from Britain Yearly Meeting's <em>Quaker Faith and Practice:</em></p>
<pre><code>Our method of conducting our meetings for church affairs is an
experience which has been tested over three hundred years. In days of
hot contest and bitter controversy the early Friends, knit together by
the glorious experience of the Holy Spirit's guidance in all of their
affairs, came to the simple understanding of how their corporate
decisions should be made. We have learned to eschew lobbying and not to
set great store by rhetoric or clever argument. The mere gaining of
debating points is found to be unhelpful and alien to the spirit of
worship which should govern the rightly ordered meeting.

    program was introduced to the Meeting as a whole at the

    level of 400 parts per million to below 350 ppm. The
    organization believes that a global grassroots movement can hold

<p><strong>Opportunity for Friends to get involved:</strong> The Sunrise Garden
    project will use existing community gardens in Colorado Springs
    as Horticultural Therapy Gardens to unite counseling, case
    management, and community members with individuals experiencing
    homelessness. Sunrise Garden will not only improve upon the
    wellness of participants, but also achieve restoration of the
    land, increased sense of community, and provide nutritious and
    accessible food and tangible gardening skills for individuals
    who are most in need. Located along the 'Homeless Corridor',
    this project will engage individuals experiencing homelessness
    by sheer proximity and convenience - providing a new, accessible
    and productive outlet for them to spend their mornings.
    Gardening will give the homeless a sense of belonging and
    contributing to our community while bringing meaning, value,
    dignity, and self-respect to their lives. Simultaneously, a case
    manager and licensed counselor will provide more intensive
    services on an individual basis as they work their way
    throughout the garden.</p>
