   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<h1>Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business</h1>
<p>Colorado Springs Friends Meeting</p>
<p>21st day of Sixth Month, 2015</p>
<p><strong>Present</strong>: <a href="/Friends/AnnGrantMartin">Ann Martin</a>, <a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah Callbeck</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/LisaLister">Lisa Lister</a>(clerk), <a href="/Friends/CarltonGamer">Carlton Gamer</a>, 
<a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly Wingate</a>, <a href="/Friends/PeterLeVar">Peter Levar</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/HollyGrasso">Holly Grasso</a> (acting recording
clerk)</p>
<p>We began with silence followed by a reading from the IMYM Faith and
Practice.</p>
<p>The minutes from Fifth month, 2015 were approved. The meeting thanks
Holly for agreeing to take minutes today.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Committee reports:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Meetinghouse committee report was accepted</strong></p>
<p>The meeting recognized <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann Daugherty</a> and 
<a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil Friesen</a> and <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly Wingate</a>
for their support and assistance in keeping the basement dry.</p>
<p>The Committee Received several quotes for installation of necessary
equipment and requests the approval to move forward with the
installation of a sump pump and update of our current drainage system
from Murphy Construction at the cost of approximately $4600.00 which is
within the available funds held by the meeting for such situations. The
meeting was advised that this is only the first step in a two part
process. Once these updates are made, it will allow the basement to dry
enough for the committee to take inventory of what damage was done.
Plans for how to address the repairs to the meetinghouse caused by the
water will be evaluated at that point. There is no cost estimate for
this second step as yet.</p>
<p>The committee lovingly requests creative suggestions for how to best put
to use the space into which the meeting is investing so much time and
resources. The meeting expressed much appreciation to <a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly Wingate</a> 
for her diligence and loving care of the meetinghouse throughout the crisis.</p>
<p>The draft of meetinghouse use guidelines was presented. The meeting
reviewed it and <strong>approved</strong> the draft with minor revisions (see
appendix).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ministry &amp; Oversight report was accepted</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finance Committee report was accepted</strong></p>
<p>Financial reports were reviewed and all was in order. Hearty thanks to
<a href="/Friends/SarahCallbeck">Sarah</a>, our bookkeeper for her ongoing diligence in tracking our
finances. The committee recognized and expressed appreciation for the
donations made by <a href="/Friends/AnnDaugherty">Ann</a>, <a href="/Friends/PhilFriesen">Phil</a> &amp; 
<a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> toward the recovery of the
meetinghouse basement.</p>
<p>The list of local organizations was reviewed to decide which group
should receive funds from the meeting. The sense of the meeting was that
the $100 should be split evenly between Care &amp; Share and Tessa. The
Finance Committee will return with an updated list for review at our
next local disbursement, which will be during twelfth month meeting for
business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Nominating Committee report was accepted</strong></p>
<p>The committee advises we are still searching for a recording clerk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other reports</strong></p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> was excited to share the amazing experience she had at yearly
meeting. She was especially inspired by workshops on the topic of
leadings and would like to share the material which spoke to her in
hopes that it will add richness to the experience of other friends. The
offer was happily accepted.</p>
<p><a href="/Friends/MollyWingate">Molly</a> also advised that the cost for attendance at yearly meeting will
be rising to meet the rising costs at the host location. This is
expected to happen incrementally over the next few years until either
the costs to attendees and the cost to yearly meeting match or another
less costly venue is located. Yearly meeting is working very hard to
make sure that the depth of activities and the ability for those who are
unable to pay to attend are maintained throughout the process.</p>
