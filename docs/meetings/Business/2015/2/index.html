   Quakerism offers a spirituality based on experiencing a loving inward presence, 
   or Inner Light, which opens us to truth, freedom and peace.  Our weekly Meeting 
   for Worship is at 10 am each First Day (Sunday).   In our Meeting for Worship, 
   we gather together in prayerful silence for one hour, opening ourselves to this 
   experience.  All are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   We also have a monthly Business Meeting after worship on the third First Day 
   of each month, where consensus decisions are made concerning the Meeting's 
   financial, spiritual, and physical matters.

<li>
<p>Reports</p>
<ol>
<li>Ministry and Oversight Committee: Minutes accepted. 
    Quaker Quest was discussed and it is a dynamic and transformative 
    inreach and outreach program that is based on the experience that 
    the Quaker way is a spiritual path for our time that is simple, 
    radical, and contemporary. We will introduce this program to the 
    Meeting as a whole at the March potluck. Email information sent 
    prior to the March potluck will include the FGC website and the 
    Quaker Quest link so that Friends can familiarize themselves. If 
    Friends approve, the consideration of implementing Quaker Quest 
    will go to the next Meeting for Business.</li>

<p>Meeting House Committee: Verbal report accepted.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>

<li>$150 was spent on cleaning and repairing the gutters and this will 
    be coordinated with the finance committee for an estimated $175 
    annual expense.</li>
<li>We continue to look at refinancing the mortgage for the meeting house </li>
<li>We are still seeking an estimate for additional electrical outlets 
    in the meeting house.</li>
<li>There was discussion of bartering work in exchange for use of the 
    meeting house.  This issue was tabled until more information is

<li>After some discussion, the clerk suggested that the Meeting House 
    Committee develop a draft policy for use of the meeting house and 
    it was suggested that it include at least some nominal fee for use.<br />
    This will serve as a starting place for further discussion about 
    meeting house usage by other groups.  We are hoping to develop a 
    clear policy that can be posted on our website.</li>
