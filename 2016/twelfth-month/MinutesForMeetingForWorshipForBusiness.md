        Clean up Sundays are working pretty well

        **Verbal report accepted**

    2.  Ministry and Oversight Committee (*See Appendix A*)

        In addition to the items on the attached report, we had a conversation
        about becoming a sanctuary church. It was pointed out that we call on
        resources and use the experience of other churches. It was pointed out
        that we have minuted being a repository for documents in support of
        claims of conscientious objection - we have not minuted support as a
        sanctuary for conscientious objectors. We could pursue this interest .
        We had a warning that our process can be used as a deterrent to get
        anything done, so be vigilant to get the process moving and not used as
        device. We could simply make a statement on the website that we support
        sanctuary . It was suggest that we use the February potluck to discuss
        sanctuary issues.

        **Report accepted**

    week, the Boulder City council accepted Nablus as a Sister City.

In the Light,

[Molly Wingate][MollyWingate]

## APPENDIX A:

Ministry and Oversight Committee Minutes, December 13, 2016

Present: [Carlton Gamer][CarltonGamer], [Jeremy Nelson][JeremyNelson] 
and [Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], Clerk

We began with Spiritual Silence and a brief check-in. We reviewed the
November minutes.

It was the sense of our meeting that the Peace and Social Concerns
Committee is an important part of our meeting, even if it goes dormant.
With the current political situation, this committee may interest
younger Friends; Millennials who need an established and respected group
to support their activism.

An organization,
[www.interfaithpowerandlight.org/](http://www.interfaithpowerandlight.org/)
has been brought to our attention. Their “mission is to be faithful
stewards of Creation by responding to global warming through the
promotion of energy conservation. M&O proposes that the Peace and
Social Concerns Committee contact the local chapter, Colorado Interfaith
Power and Light to see how we can, as a Meeting get involved.
http://www.coloradoipl.org/contact-us/

M&O understands that several Friends have the intention of bringing our
website up to date. We suggest that our website reflect the Meeting's
desire to be a sanctuary for Conscience Objectors. Our website can also
have links that are helpful to Conscience Objectors.

M&O has completed our "Friendly Calls" for 2016. We will begin 2017's
"Friendly Calls" to Members and regular Attenders next June.

In the Light, [Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], Clerk for Ministry & Oversight

## APPENDIX B:

**Finance Committee Meeting**

Twelfth month, Twelfth day, 2016

Present: [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallback] (Bookkeeper, Treasurer, & Clerk) 
and [Lisa Lister][LisaLister] (Recorder) and [John Robey][JohnRobey] were in attendance. 
The meeting was held at
Lisa’s home.

We began with silence and settling.

We carefully reviewed financial reports for the period ending 11-30-2016
and found all to be in good order:

*   Cash Flow Report
*   Ent Savings Detail Update

The 2017 budget was approved at the Eleventh Month Meeting for Business.
There will be very minor tweaking to the General Fund donation
projections because pledges are still arriving.

This month, the Meeting decides on donations to local organizations. We
have $100 for this purpose.

We closed in silence.

[Lisa][LisaLister]

Recorder
